Zero pressure to stick around—just click unsubscribe if you don't want to get it (don't worry, I won't be notified).\n\n👩‍💻 Victoria Vibe Coders Meetup: I'm hosting a casual meetup for any Victoria-based vibe coders on January 20th 9-10:30AM at Habit Coffee (Pandora location). Details and RSVP here.\n\nI'm also HIRING an experienced vibe coder: I'm hiring a full-time vibe coder to work directly with me. You don't have to actually know how to code (although helpful) but you must be an absolute super genius with Claude Code and similar tools. Email me if you're interested with the subject line \"Vibe Coder\" and share 2-3 things you've built and a few bullets on your background. I don't care about formal education, just scrappiness.

what I'm thinking about…\r\nDivorce is awesome.\r\nYes, I know. Clutch your pearls and gasp.\n\nThe idea that staying married, no matter how miserable, is noble.\n\nThat suffering together is somehow better than finding happiness apart.\n\nMany people I know live quiet lives of desperation because of this.\n\nNot everyone. But a good number of people I know are deeply unhappy in their marriages.\n\nLike they're always having to explain themselves, but never feel understood.\n\nLike they live with the world's most irritating and critical roommate.\n\nIn some cases, it's subtle. In others, it's severe.\n\nIt's almost like they have a job they hate—except they're afraid to quit, so they have to share a bed with their boss until one of them dies.\n\nThey know how every conversation is going to go.

for most, if you pull on the emotional thread, it's not actually about that—it's about shame.\n\nAbout admitting they failed at the one relationship society told you was supposed to last forever.\n\nThe idea of all the other parents whispering about them at school drop off or becoming a cautionary tale at dinner parties.\n\nOr having to tell their parents their marriage is over.\n\nBecause even today, a time when over 40% of marriages dissolve, divorce is shockingly taboo.\n\nThere's an assumption that marriage must be preserved at all costs—that avoiding the brief pain of divorce is worth decades of unhappiness.\n\nWhat's bizarre is that breaking up isn't taboo if you aren't married.\n\nBreak up with your girlfriend of five years?

you try?\" they ask in a hushed tone, their face ashen, like you've just confessed to a crime. \"I know a great couples therapist I can introduce you to.\"\n\nIt's not just that they think it's sad—that's fine, it is sad—but that they often seem to think it's morally wrong.\n\nI got divorced about 4 years ago, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nWe have two beautiful sons. We had years of genuine love and laughter. I became who I am in part because of that relationship.\n\nOf course, that doesn't change the fact that we ended up not enjoying being married to one another.\n\nNot dramatically. We just grew into different people who wanted different lives.\n\nThe person I fell in love with when I was 27 wasn't the same person sitting across from me at 35.\n\nWhile we liked and loved one another, we didn't enjoy having our lives intertwined.","title":"Take a deep breath and bear with me here.

diverged in interests, preferences, and how we wanted our lives to unfold.\n\nAnd these misalignments came out as blowups over a thousand innocuous decisions.\n\nEach one became a tiny explosion, damaging the relationship. A meta-fight that was really about both of us being in a fundamental conflict that could never be resolved.\n\nEventually, we both drifted into frustration and stopped trying.\n\nWe became incompatible and unhappy. We stopped enjoying one another.\n\nWe tried it all: couples counselling. Date night. Taking space.\n\nIt just flat out didn't work anymore and we were making one another miserable.\n\nSaying the words. Talking to lawyers. Separating assets. Telling the kids.\n\nRediscovering the hobbies you abandoned because they caused friction.\n\nBut don't forget, this is as much for you as it is for your kids.","title":"Take a deep breath and bear with me here.

love this line from Dr. James Hollis' incredible book (one of my favorites from the last few years), Living An Examined Life:\n\n\"The greatest burden a child can bear is the unlived life of the parent.\"\r\nHe means kids don't grow up in your intentions—they live in your tone, your tension, and your patterns.\n\nWhen parents stay in a marriage that's quietly miserable, the house becomes a low-grade war zone: tension, sarcasm, silence, little detonations over nothing.\n\nThe child adapts by becoming an emotional accountant. Tracking moods, smoothing conflicts, shrinking their needs.\n\nThat's the \"unlived life.\" Your fear of making a hard change becomes their job to manage in their own life and future relationships.\n\nYou might think I'm exaggerating here, but the science backs this up.\n\nWhen my ex-wife and I were contemplating separating, I was particularly worried about how it would affect our kids.","title":"Take a deep breath and bear with me here.

ideal is two happy parents who are calm and loving in the same house.\n\nThe next best is two happy parents who are calm and loving living separately.\n\nThe worst of all, is two miserable parents fighting and modeling a bad relationship in the same house.\"\r\nI went on to learn that this is backed up by studies.\n\nResearchers tracked 96,000 families and found that kids whose parents stayed in unhappy marriages had higher rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm than kids whose unhappy parents split up. Staying together was worse.\n\nAnother 12-year study found that kids in high-conflict homes actually did better after their parents split.\n\nSo many of us martyr ourselves \"for the kids\" and in doing so damage our children—teaching them that love looks like a festering garbage can of resentment.","title":"I confided in a divorced friend about this, and here's what he told

know what's worse than breaking your partner's heart, upsetting your kids, dealing with gossip, and spending time with lawyers?\n\nSpending decades in a home filled with resentment, where everyone slowly becomes a worse version of themselves.\n\nIt might feel selfish, but it's for everyone else as much as you.\n\nIt will allow your partner to find someone who fits them better.\n\nEnable your kids to grow up in two calmer, happier homes instead of one tense one.\n\nAnd give everyone a real shot at peace—even if the path is rocky.\n\nOne of the main reasons that I got divorced was, when I

universally, everyone is glad they separated.\n\nWe got to the light on the other end of the tunnel.\n\nAnd often, an even deeper relationship with your kids.\n\n\"When your friend tells you they're getting divorced, don't go, 'Oh, I'm sorry.'\n\nYou're making them feel bad for being really happy, which isn't fair.\n\nLet me explain something: divorce is always good news.\n\nI know that sounds weird, but it's true—because no good marriage has ever ended in divorce. It's really that simple.\n\nThere's never been a marriage where they were really happy, they just had a great thing, and then they got divorced.\n\nBut that has happened zero times.

You should probably think about getting divorced.\n\n–Joseph Campbell\r\nAlso, there's a wonderful book on this topic called Sacred Cows: The Truth About Divorce and Marriage. I recommend checking it out if you find yourself thinking about this.\n\nI loved this quote that my friend Kevin Rose shared in his newsletter the other day:\r\n\"When you fight something, you're tied to it forever. As long as you're fighting it, you're giving it power.\"\n\n–Anthony de Mello\r\nAs somebody who frequently limits himself from eating unhealthy foods, alcohol, etc, I definitely relate to this quote. So often complete abstention leads to a painful obsession in the opposite direction.\n\nSidenote: I've been really enjoying Anthony de Mello's book Stop Fixing Yourself on this topic.

you have ADHD, I highly recommend checking out a drug called Guanfacine.\r\nIt's not a primary treatment, but something that you add on.\n\nVyvanse was a revelation for me. It gave me incredible focus and flow states, but it also revved up my anxiety in the evenings and sometimes made it difficult to sleep.\n\nFor the past six months or so, I've added Guanfacine XR (brand name Intuiniv) at night and my anxiety is almost non-existent (day or night).\n\nIt has given me this crazy, persistent zen-like calm that I've never felt. (I assume this is how people who don't have ADHD feel?)\n\nNo matter what is going on in my life right now, I don't feel particularly anxious.\n\nYes, I get stressed, but I don't have anxious looping thoughts, sweaty palms, and all the typical symptoms I used to have 24/7.\n\nI can't identify any other reason why my anxiety would be this low other than that it perfectly lines up with adding this

medical advice! Ask your doctor about it and do your own research. I also highly recommend this HubermanLab episode with Dr. John Kruse. It's by far the best deep dive on treating ADHD and it inspired me to investigate Guanfacine.\n\nNote: The Guanfacine doses for ADHD are much higher than dosing for other conditions, so make sure your doctor gives you the right prescription based on your body weight and also make sure you slowly increase your dose. I started at 1mg and increased by 1mg every 1-2 weeks until I reached my target dose and experienced zero side effects. ChatGPT helped me identify the correct dose.\n\nI'm hosting a Think Week in April.\r\nAll year, you're busy.\n\nBack-to-back meetings.\r\nA never-ending conveyor belt of emails.\r\nMindless

are hand-selecting a crew of people we know well, but also opening up a few spots for interesting strangers. The kind of people who make everyone they interact with feel warm and gooey inside who are doing interesting things in the world. Some will be just starting out, others will be at later stages. This mix keeps it interesting for everyone.\n\nEach day, we'll learn something, discuss something, and share an experience. We're going to have some sessions facilitated by a speaker, others will be facilitated by the group. We may also have a few mystery performers ;-)\n\nNo miserable conference food.

1 new friend\r\n✅ 1 new idea\r\n✅ 1 thing that changed your mind\r\n✅ A feeling of calm and connection\n\nIf this sounds up your alley and you'd like to attend, then we're all ears.\n\nPricing is set based on the size of your income/company. Those of us with large businesses contribute more than those in the startup phase or in creative fields—we just think that's fair and it allows us to include an especially interesting mix of people from all walks of life.\n\nLocation to be shared once you're accepted, but it's about 45 minutes away from Victoria, Canada.\n\nApply to join here - we only have ~5 spots available for interesting strangers.\n\nMy friend Justin Mares is a complete health nut.

a good sport and takes it in stride—but within a few years I'm often eating humble pie. He's usually right.\n\nHe's an obsessive reader of science and always a few years ahead.\n\nRecently, he told me about his new company, Lightwork.\n\nThey're working on something that nobody is thinking enough about—yet.\n\nIn an effort to drive energy efficiency, they've become airtight.\n\nThis is great for the environment, but terrible for your health.\n\nAll the particulates, VOCs, mold spores, and moisture that used to escape is now trapped inside with you.\n\nContaminants like PFAS quietly entering our water supply.\n\nYour home has become a completely different environment than

maybe a cancer diagnosis that came a little too young.\n\nIn the meantime, your house was silently contributing to it all along.\n\nThat's what Justin's new company is working on. Helping people test their homes and protect themselves from all these problems.\n\nI consider myself pretty nerdy about this stuff. I had my air and water tested when I moved in, plus have air purifiers all over and a filtered water tap.\n\nLightwork goes a level deeper.

found black mold behind a wall she'd walked past a thousand times.\n\nAnother discovered her son's bedroom had the worst air quality in the house, full of VOCs.\n\nA third had been being slowly poisoned by formaldehyde from cheap furniture.\n\nEach was suffering from health issues, but none of them had connected their symptoms to their homes. In each case, they were an easy fix.\n\nMy friend who discovered the black mold, for example, realized it was the cause of her brutal brain fog and fatigue and was able to treat her mold exposure and recover.\n\nIt turns out that Benjamin Franklin was right: \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\"\n\nSo roll your eyes all you want, but I think Justin is on point on this one.

made a winter playlist on Spotify full of cozy semi-depressing tunes for a rainy/snowy day. Listen here\r\nA random thought: Using Google Search in 2026 is like using the Yellow Pages in 2004.\r\nI was absolutely fascinated by this interview with Dr. Kevin Tracy on The Tim Ferriss Show. He is treating rheumatoid arthritis using vagus nerve stimulator implants the size of a grain of rice. The stories are remarkable, and the science to back it up is real. So interesting. Listen here: Spotify / Apple Podcasts\r\nIf you don't already, follow me on Instagram. That is all.\r\nVictoria stuff: I'm obsessed with a new sauna place called Aerth in James Bay. My favorite feature: they have two saunas: the social sauna and the quiet sauna. Go in the social sauna, and you're opting in to talking to strangers, which is one of my favorite pastimes. Check them out\r\nThere's a really great new pasta place called Lumache on Douglas. We went with some friends and were really impressed.\r\nI'm biased, because I'm a co-owner, but the team at Part & Parcel is on fire lately. The tasting menu is mind-bogglingly tasty. I highly recommend you go check it out. Also: It was just announced that our head chef, Nick, will be on the next season of Top Chef Canada!\r\nThere's a new hot pot place called Big Way Hot Pot that just opened near UVIC. It's a neat concept: you get to fill your pot from a huge wall filled with meats, tofu, noodles, and veggies, then they cook it for you and deliver it to your table.

up until his death at 99, he kept burning through an endless pile of books, helping a young neighbor, Avi Mayer, build a real-estate company that went on to buy thousands of garden apartments in Southern California, and tinkering away on his side hobby of designing college dormitories.\n\nMy business partner Chris and I were lucky enough to spend a fair amount of time with him during his twilight years. I can confirm that he was hilarious and razor sharp until the very end—often holding court until late in the night at dinner parties full of what he jokingly dubbed his \"groupies\" (young investing

take the high road, it's far less crowded\"\r\nHe didn't waste time on bad people and focused on operating in a way that prioritized win-win outcomes. If he trusted you, that was it—he didn't want to have a 60-page contract.\n\n\"The great lesson of life is to get toxic, unreliable people the hell out of your life — and do it fast.\"\r\n\"The best way to get what you want is to deserve what you want.\"\r\nOne of his favorite ideas was that the best way to get a great spouse, great friends, and great partners is to deserve them. That's a very un-2025 idea—just quietly become the kind of person other good people are happy to bet on and build a life with.\r\n\"Envy, resentment, revenge, and self-pity are disastrous modes of thought. It's very counterproductive for an individual to feel like a victim—even if he is.\"\r\nBy any normal standard, he had earned the right to be bitter. Divorce, the death of a child, major health problems. Instead, he chose to push on and continue contributing.\r\n\"I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning

software company they're working with had a whole team doing miserable, manual work—reaching out to churned customers and trying to win them back.\n\nHis automation should cut resources required by half, saving $50,000/year, and he estimates it'll add around $300k in ARR.\n\nIf this plays out as expected, that's an extra $310,000 in profit for the owner this year (and $350,000 the following year).\n\nIf we assume the business is worth 10x EBITDA (it's growing nicely and high quality), that would mean they paid David and his team at Digital People, our AI automation agency, $40k to increase the value of their business by $3.5 million.\n\nThat's a 775% cash-on-cash return in year one, and an 87x long-term return.\n\nIt's the wild west in AI automation, and I'm astounded how many

few of my favorite things from 2025\r\nIt's almost Christmas, so I figured now would be a good time to share an annual roundup of highlights from the year.\n\n🎵 Songs I Couldn't Stop Listening To\r\nIt Might Be Raining by Dan Mangan\r\nDan made me cry a lot this year. In a good way.\r\nSong In My Head by Madison Cunningham\r\nThis song is ear heroin. It's been stuck in my head all year.\r\nDear Boy by Paul McCartney\r\nI had somehow never heard this album until this year.\r\nStrawberry Fields Forever (Take 1) by The Beatles\r\nI like this more than the album version.\r\nDon't Be Cruel by Billy Swan\r\nHaunting and wonderful.\r\n📚 Favorite Books\r\nThe Courage to Be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi & Fumitake Koga\r\nThis book is oddly written (it's translated from Japanese), but it changed my life. I wrote about its effect on me here.\r\nThe Kid Stays In The Picture by Robert Evans\r\nRobert Evans goes from pretty-boy actor to running Paramount during The Godfather era, then nukes his life in a haze of ego and excess. Pure Hollywood popcorn—probably half true, but insanely entertaining.\r\nBarbarian Days by William Finnegan\r\nI'd been gifted this book like three times but had zero interest in reading it. I don't care about surfing. God was I wrong. Beautiful stuff.\r\nRabbit At Rest by John Updike\r\nI finally made it through the entire Rabbit series. This book was by far the weakest of the four, and it still makes my top 5 list. Updike is, in my opinion, the best fiction writer of the last century.\r\nLorne: The Man Who Invented Saturday Night Live by Susan Morrison\r\nA window into the kind of person who does the same job obsessively, week after week, for 50 years. So many great anecdotes about Lorne and his crazy famous friends. I couldn't put this down.\r\n🎬 Movies I Loved\r\nEternity\r\nA man dies and goes to heaven, followed shortly by his wife—who re-connects with her hunky ex-husband, creating a hilarious love triangle. My favorite film from TIFF.\r\nSentimental Value\r\nA movie about boomer dads who compress their trauma into blood diamonds deep inside themselves. Great stuff.\r\nNosferatu\r\nSomehow both absolutely terrifying (there are a few scenes I can't scrub from my mind almost a year later) and hilarious. Robert Eggers never fails to make my skin crawl.\r\nPee-wee as Himself\r\nBrought back long forgotten memories of watching Pee-wee's Playhouse as a kid. I had had some vague notion that he was a pedophile or had done something really bad. It turns out, his career was unfairly destroyed—he was just a closeted gay guy who made a bad decision in a porn theater. A profoundly unfair story about an incredible performer.\r\nThe Naked Gun\r\nThe first movie I've seen in theaters with the boys (ages 6 and 8) where we all laughed our heads off together. Pure gold. Akiva Schaffer for president.\r\n😂 Hardest Laughs\r\nGianmarco Soresi - Thief of Joy\r\nStumbled on this and was dying within five minutes.\r\nShane Gillis' Trump impersonations on Kill Tony\r\nIf you close your eyes, it's Trump.\r\nJon Glaser's Soothing Meditations for the Solitary Dog\r\nAlmost made me crash my car from laughing.\r\nConner O'Malley's Slugs video\r\nUnhinged as always.\r\nTilek All Better - Strangers Ease My Soul-Crushing Battle with Anxiety\r\nVery John Wilson. The guy who walks up to him in the park 😂\r\n🛒 Rampant Consumerism\r\nAeroPress Coffee Grinder\r\nI've been beta testing this thing for months and it was worth the wait. My favorite feature: it comes with a drill bit for fast electric grinding.\r\nLaifen P3 Pro Razor\r\nApple-level design for a razor. Makes my old one feel like a joke.\r\nGarmin Bounce\r\nDespite what To Catch a Predator would have you believe, it's almost statistically impossible your child will be abducted. But just for peace of mind, you can get a Garmin Bounce.\r\nTRMNL e-ink display\r\nLives in my kitchen, shows countdowns and calendars (and my death clock!). Love it.\r\nZefferano Poldina Pro\r\nBattery powered lights for indoor/outdoor dining, parties, or anywhere you need to create low-light ambiance. Instant cozy—perfect for dinner parties.\r\n💻 Nerdy Stuff\r\nLindy\r\nI've built dozens of amazing automations with this thing. Completely obsessed.\r\nBeeper\r\nSuperhuman but for texts. Combines iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, and Slack.\r\nWisprFlow\r\niOS + Mac dictation app that actually works. I text with my voice now.\r\nRamp\r\nAfter years of misery managing corporate cards with Canadian banks, Ramp finally came to Canada and I love it. If your company has credit cards, you need to switch.\r\nFreedom\r\nBlocks misery-inducing sites like TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit. Not having easy access to social media and news has made my life infinitely calmer.\r\n🙋‍♀️ Favorite People\r\nI got to know a lot of really cool people this year.

Dan Mangan\r\nI needed a musician for my Interesting People event last summer and someone threw out Dan's name. I recognized it, but honestly, I'd never heard his music.\n\nWe booked him without a thought, and I had no idea what to expect.\n\nDan got up after a string of comedians and made an awkward joke about singing sad songs after all those laughs.\n\nThen, he gave the most incredible performance I've ever seen. Within minutes, I had tears streaming down my face, and he ended the show with everyone singing together. Unbelievable.\n\nI've gotten to know Dan since, and he's a lovely, thoughtful, and supremely talented dude. I have a man crush on him. You should listen to his music and read his Substack.\n\n2. Robbie Bent\r\nRobbie runs a cult. At least that's what Toronto Life calls it. Going to his bathhouse, Othership, feels like a religious experience.

spent a few hours wandering Toronto together and talking about life and I was struck by his ambition and openness.\n\nIn an increasingly lonely and disconnected world, we need more people like Robbie.\n\nSo impressed with what he's built. The OG Othership is in Toronto, but he just opened new locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan. You should go.\n\n3. Alex Forman and Nash Park\r\nI had completely written off standup comedy in Victoria, but got dragged to an OkDope comedy show.\n\nAlex and Nash are hilarious, great people, and doing the best standup in town. If you live in Victoria (or Vancouver Island), you should go to a show.\n\n4. Gillian Liu\r\nI was speaking at a random ecommerce conference and Gillian happened to be behind me in the breakfast line.

working full-time at an insurance company, she bootstrapped an online Korean beauty business called Kiyoko that hit over $10,000,000 in revenue.\n\nShe's cool. If you're in Toronto, you should email her for a coffee.\n\nMore importantly, if you like having beautiful skin, you should visit Kiyoko and stock up.\n\n5. Josh Franklin\r\nOver the last few years, I've started going to bed at 9 PM, but whenever I'd ask non-lame people what they were up to on weekends, they'd always say 'Club Loading.'\n\nIt turns out that two guys had taken over a former grocery store and built a makeshift nightclub —the type you'd typically find in Williamsburg, not Victoria.\n\nI met Josh, one of the founders, through mutual friends.

suited to what it does.\n\nBeing a platypus means embracing a certain amount of chaos.\n\nWhen you have dozens of businesses doing very different things, something is always breaking, stalling, or

started Tiny with a simple mission: to buy wonderful, profitable businesses for the long term, almost always from founders.\n\nOver time, that led us to own an eclectic mix of companies—not because we wanted complexity, but because we follow great founders, strong cash flow, and enduring products wherever we find them.\n\nUnfortunately, that complexity showed up in our share price. Since we went public in 2023, our stock dropped more than 80% from peak to trough.\n\nAt one point in 2025, our entire business was valued at less than $200 million.\n\n$200M+ Revenue\r\n$65M+

it will weigh what matters: the earnings we deliver over the coming decades.\n\nOur job is to keep growing earnings so the weighing machine catches up.\n\nSpeaking of which, we recently filed our latest quarterly earnings report (Q3 2025):\n\nRevenue of $54.0 million ⬆️Up 16% year-over-year\r\nRecurring Revenue of $16.9 million ⬆️ Up 72% year-over-year\r\nAdjusted EBITDA of $10.1 million ⬆️Up

Stuff:\r\nMy favorite NPS (net promoter score) software, Delighted, just announced that they are shutting down. So our team at Kno just launched their own. It's really good, and made especially for ecommerce. Check it out.\r\nThe other day, I spoke at the UVic business school and this South American guy walked me to my car, peppering me with questions. He was an interesting guy—studying business and physics, with dreams of building quantum computers. As an aside, he mentioned his wife was trying to break into DJing.\n\nI told him I'd listen to her stuff and share it with some friends who throw parties. I ended up really liking this mix she posted on YouTube. Check out DJ Inna Brik.\r\nI just discovered Emitt Rhodes. One of those one-hit wonder guys from the 60's who could have been huge but never was. I love this song (Promises I've Made).\r\nYoda for agency owners. My old pal Mark, who was employee #3 or so at Metalab and ran the business for over a decade, wrote a book about all the chaos and learnings from the early days. It's really good, and he is awesome.

people want money. A nice car. A flashy watch. A beautiful house.\n\nWhy? Because they think if they get those things (money, success, an impressive outfit), it will somehow translate into the life they dream of.\n\nA life where they have a great partner, interesting friends, and a community that welcomes them.\n\nThey crave connection—they just try to get it in the wrong way.\n\nThe reality is that building the connection we all crave doesn't require money, success, or fame—in fact, those things often get in the way of it.\n\nInstead, building friendships and community simply requires openness, warmth, and consistency.\n\nAfter decades of striving for

you can build a life that revolves around friends and family (plus sleep and exercise), you have most of the key ingredients for a wonderful life.\n\nScience backs this up: decades of studies like the Harvard Study of Adult Development show that close relationships are the strongest predictor of long-term health and well-being.\n\nI've always been lucky that making friends comes naturally to me, but one thing I've struggled with over the years is creating cohesive groups and communities.\n\nI've always been jealous of those people who have a \"crew\".\n\nThey've all been best friends since elementary school.\r\nTheir wives and husbands get along perfectly.\r\nThey go on vacation together and post cute group photos on Instagram.\r\nIf you aren't one of them, they're very irritating.\n\nI've always had a wide ranging group of friends.

where I've previously failed is creating cohesive groups.\n\nIn the past, I had a million disparate relationships, but few collections of people that I'd feel confident inviting over to my house without feeling low-grade anxiety.\n\nBack to Lina. She shared a trick that I loved.\r\nI asked her how she builds friendships. She told me her secret:\n\n\"Whenever I go out for a group dinner, pickleball, movie, whatever—I always create a group thread and give it a funny name. Then, if I like the group, I just keep texting the group thread. Before you know it, everyone gets comfortable, chemistry gets built, and then you have this little crew to do stuff with.\"\n\nSomething that takes almost no effort—but when I thought about it, I

here's what I've realized: while Lina's group text move is perfect for sparking new friendships, it only gets you half of the way there.\n\nThe real magic happens when those spontaneous hangouts become intentional and structured.\n\nThat's why, in my own life, I'm focused on creating rituals.\n\nRituals are things you do over and over again, typically with the same group—the glue that turns strangers into friends, and friends into family.\n\nUnlike in college, community doesn't just happen anymore.\n\nIf you aren't intentional about building friendship, you flat out won't.\n\nYou'll go to work. Come home. Put your kids to bed. Occasionally have a double date with another couple. Go make small talk at soccer practice and ballet.\n\nThose things are all fine.

can rarely go deep in the first few hangouts. It takes time to get to know one another.\n\nThe same is true of groups. I've been in business forums—confidential support groups where we talk through personal, family, and business issues—for almost twenty years. That's where I first discovered the power of rituals.\n\nA group of six of us meet once a month and attendance is mandatory. Unless your kid's in the ER, you come.\n\nWe each prepare updates, sharing highs and lows from our personal, family, and business lives, and take turns sharing our updates one by one.\n\nWhen I first

all ran businesses in different industries and to be honest, I didn't think I really clicked with most of them.\n\nFlash forward twenty years, and my forum mates are some of my best friends.\n\nWhat made it work was the consistency and structure.\n\nIt became a special ritual—something I did every month—and over time we got insanely close.\n\nSo, over the last few years, inspired by the success of my forum, I've focused on building more recurring rituals.\n\n👨‍💼 Forum\r\nI've now expanded to four different groups of 6 people. Each meets once a month, so I do one per week\n\nI find this creates weekly time to catch up with my friends while adding structure that pushes us to talk about deeper issues. It's part bullshit session, part group therapy, part business strategy.\n\nMy forums have resulted in some of my deepest, highest trust friendships and years of incredible laughs, group trips, and

Pickleball\r\nI play 2-3 times a week, and I have an ever-growing group thread that we're always adding random friends of friends to.\n\nIt's great exercise and a fun way to casually get to know people I'd never meet otherwise.\n\n🥪 Entrepreneur's Lunch Club (ELC)\r\nI rent out a restaurant once a month and invite a broad range of local entrepreneurs to have lunch.\n\nWe share recent wins and struggles, introduce anybody that's new, and then sit down for lunch with no small talk allowed (we use conversation cards to prompt people to talk about deeper stuff).\n\nELC has created a lively community of local entrepreneurs who can band together to solve problems and connected a bunch of my favorite entrepreneurs who wouldn't otherwise know each other.\n\n👥 Interesting People\r\nOnce a

call it Interesting People. It's not a conference—it's 100% focused on getting everyone to click and get to know one another.\n\nI run it with my friend Nick Gray, who literally wrote the book on creating events that create connection and I can safely say that it's unlike any event you've been to.\n\nI joke that Interesting People functions like FedEx: once a day, all of their delivery planes land in Anchorage, Alaska and swap packages. This masterful coordination gives FedEx the ability to deliver packages anywhere in the world within 24 hours.\n\nIP is an opportunity for me to do the same with my entire network of friends from across the world. Doing so always results in good things: new friendships, business and creative partnerships, and a tribal community.\n\n⛪ Sunday\r\nA few friends and I recently started Sunday—a secular group that

always envied my religious friends. They just seem happier. But I don't think that joy comes from biblical stories—I think it comes from the ritual itself.\n\nEvery week, they get a built-in moment to pause, zoom out, reflect on life, and connect with their community.\n\nSo, we decided to build that same structure, minus the religion. Sunday is our weekly gathering for introspection, gratitude, and community.\n\nIf you're in Victoria and interested in joining, send me an email.\n\n🏕️ Camp Dad\r\nEvery August, me and a bunch of my dad friends rent out a summer camp for a few days with our kids.\n\nIt's the ultimate win-win: the kids make incredible core memories together and become buddies, our partners get a break, we all take

Father-Son Trips\r\nI just started doing special 1-on-1 trips with each of my boys once a year.\n\nLast week, I got back from a trip to Disneyland with my oldest son, and just looking at the photos makes me feel like I did some low-dose MDMA. I keep realizing that I only have 10 years left—at most—for special stuff like this, and the hourglass is almost half drained.\n\nThe days are long, but the years are short, and between this and Camp Dad, I feel like I've started building some core memories for the boys to lean on when they're older and I'm annoying them at family dinners.\n\nAll of these rituals have created their own unique

requires a bit of advanced planning, but once you're in the groove it feels effortless to have a vibrant social life. And it all starts with a group thread!\n\nWhat about you? Got any good social tricks or rituals? Reply to this email, I'd love to hear about them.\n\nI've had this song on repeat for days now.\r\n'Rich Men North of Richmond' by Oliver Anthony (Spotify).\n\nIf you haven't heard it, you should listen. I get tingles up my neck every time I listen.\n\nIf you study history, there's this recurring pattern—what Robert Greene would call the cycle of generations.\n\nEvery few decades, the pendulum swings. The establishment tightens its grip, the next generation pushes back, and suddenly you get an explosion of extremes on the left and the right. Rebellion, control, and chaos.\n\nYou see it today.

Mark Twain famously said, history doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme.\n\nAnd right now it feels like we're rhyming with the late 60's/early 70's.\n\nBack then, that tension produced some of the best music of all time. Protest music about what was happening in the country.\n\nFortunate Son – Creedence Clearwater Revival (class hypocrisy and the rich sending the poor to fight their wars)\r\nFor What It's Worth – Buffalo Springfield (civil unrest and generational tension)\r\nGive Peace a Chance – John Lennon (a call to end war and embrace unity)\r\nThe Times They Are A-Changin' – Bob Dylan (a warning to those in power that the world and its values are shifting fast)\r\nThese songs are all incredibly melodic middle fingers to the system.\n\nBut unless I'm missing something, we are in a similar time right

are the Trump protest songs? Who is our generation's Bob Dylan or John Lennon?\n\nA song so good that even the most ardent Republican father can't help but sing along to it as he drives his kids to school.\n\nI don't know what it's like to grow up in poverty in the American South, and I doubt I align with his politics, but I can't stop listening to it.\n\nIt's so moving. I can't imagine that anyone with a heart could listen to his voice cracking and not feel something towards the struggling working class people he's singing about.\n\nMy last newsletter was about

finally shut down Flow, the productivity software company I started back in 2010.\n\nFor reference, if I'd just invested in an S&P 500 index fund with that cash, it would be enough to retire with $300,000+ in annual passive income.\n\nEven worse: it would be worth over $30 million today.\n\nHere's what happened…\r\nIn 2009, Metalab was a small but profitable agency.\n\nThe business was making a couple hundred thousand dollars a year in profit and I was trying to figure out how to invest the profits.\n\nAgencies can be great businesses, but they don't have much recurring revenue, and they're only as good as your last project.\n\nI wanted to build something scalable and recurring—something like Basecamp.\n\nWe built Flow, a simple to-do app that helped teams collaborate.\n\nWe

a team a quarter of the size, and a fraction of the money, we had built what I felt was a superior product.\n\nAround this time, Dustin and I had coffee in San Francisco.\n\nHe told me that they had raised a huge amount of money and that we'd be stronger together. Perhaps we should join forces instead?\n\nHe was super nice, but I wasn't into the idea. After all, we were Apple and they were Microsoft. And we were allergic to venture capital—we were bootstrappers, baby!\n\n(Emphasis on nice. He is a very down-to-earth and humble dude. Ironically, both Dustin and Christian Reber from Wunderlist, my two key competitors who I wanted to hate, turned out to be really good guys.)\n\nHe walked me through their investors, war chest, and

were forced to downsize to breakeven and shift to a team based in India to keep the remaining customers happy, and Flow became a shadow of its former self.\n\nFor the past three years, it's been on life support.\n\nBut this last week, we let it go gently into the good night.\n\nI signed the documents to dissolve the company and exhaled a sigh of relief.\n\nMy most epic business disaster was finally over. With many expensive scars to show for it.\n\nIn retrospect, we were like Fiji waging war on the United States with a collection of AK-47s and speedboats vs. artillery and aircraft carriers.\n\nLooking

I think that failure is the best teacher, I think it's even better to learn by reading about my failures in a newsletter instead of losing $10 million yourself.\n\nDon't bring a knife to a gun fight. If you are in a competitive VC-funded space, it's foolish to compete without raising money.\r\nProduct isn't enough. The best product doesn't always win, and the quality of your product is not a long-term competitive advantage.\r\nDistribution matters. \"Build it and they will come\" only works in movies. In software, distribution beats organic growth nine times out of ten.\r\nAvoid commodity categories. Every developer in the world wakes up thinking \"I should build a to-do list app,\" and people love jumping between productivity apps and workflows. There is no moat in productivity—avoid it if you can.\r\nKnow your numbers. Running a SaaS business without deeply understanding churn, LTV, CAC, etc., is like flying a plane without instrumentation: really stupid and dangerous.\r\nWhen something isn't working, cut your losses early and move on.

called TRMNL and I have it show countdowns to birthdays, holidays, and vacations, plus our family calendar. It's really well crafted and totally extensible. If you can code (or use ChatGPT) you can basically have it display anything you can dream up). The battery lasts forever and it's super thin and light. Very cool product.\n\nOn the one in my kitchen, I just added a countdown clock of how many days ChatGPT estimates I have before I die (17,451 days).

me, I felt the failures.

run five businesses as CEO at the same time, barely able to keep track of what was happening in any of them. Always rushing off to put out a fire in one to the detriment of another.\n\nSure, I had great people working for me, but I'd usually put the wrong people in the wrong roles and get the incentives wrong.\n\nThese businesses usually ended how you'd imagine. The list above is a graveyard littered with many failures. Basically, the world's most stressful real-world MBA.\n\nOf course, this is the nature of starting companies. The reality is that most fail.

can describe it to your parents and whether it does $1M or $100M of revenue, it can be profitable and sustainable.\n\nI don't like businesses that are all or nothing. Most entrepreneurs are dopamine seeking, and I think quick positive feedback (revenue and profits) is critical, especially when starting out. Many shoot-for-the-moon types would disagree with me—that's ok.\n\nFor most people, the goal of starting a business is twofold: freedom and financial security. A low stakes, high likelihood of success vs. a venture backed startup is a far more likely way to achieve both.\n\n2. Low Competition and Complexity\r\nThe easier the business is to operate and the fewer smart competitors you have, the better.\n\nBad: An AI startup. Endless venture capitalists all funding the same or similar ideas to compete with you.

You find out that all the restaurants in town have to clean their own grease traps and hate doing it. You start a grease trap cleaning and hauling business. Zero competition. Solid margins. High need that won't go away.

For example:\n\nA few years ago, we partnered with Andrew Huberman on Mateina, a canned yerba mate business. Normally we would run screaming from space (highly competitive and misery inducing), but we had an unfair advantage: Andrew's reputation and authentic love of yerba mate.

Obvious Need\r\nIt should be obvious why this business exists. You need to be solving a problem that people struggle with, and often the best business ideas come from your own struggles. Think about your life. What is making it difficult or annoying? Invert and work backwards from there.\n\nIt's critical that when you explain your offering to a potential customer, they immediately know exactly why they need it.\n\nBad: A travel roller bag that has a built in red light therapy panel. Is anybody asking for this? No, and therefore you need to spend endless time educating them on why they'd want it.\n\nGood: Pressure washing. Anyone can look at their driveway and see it's filthy and covered in moss. They'll pay money to make that go away.\n\n4.

you need web design or social management, they are amazing - you should hire them)\n\nBad: A founder or co-founder who is half-in.

They care 10x more than you do.\n\nImportant detail: Your co-founder must read books or otherwise have a mechanism for improvement (mentorship, support groups, podcasts, etc), otherwise they are doomed to fail.

is what works for me because of my personality—you might be focused enough to not need a co-founder at all, or need a different type.\n\nThe Visionary and the Integrator\r\nThis is something I've only recently been able to formalize—and it's been a revelation.\n\nEarlier this year, I got diagnosed with ADHD and suddenly my entire way of being made sense.\n\nI'm an inch deep and a mile wide. I come up with more ideas than I can act on, and I have boundless optimism.\n\nBut I'm terrible with details and follow-through. I forget what was just agreed to the moment I leave the room and get overwhelmed fast.\n\nThis has always made me strong on strategy and bad at execution. I know all the dance moves, but can't stay focused long enough to perform them.\n\nThe way I've solved this is through delegation. I've never been successful without a team of incredible people around me who don't have ADHD as a counter balance.

used to frustrate me. I thought, if I just read more books on management or optimized my systems, I'd finally become a great leader.\n\nTurns out, I just needed to stop fighting my wiring.\n\nAfter twenty years, I've realized: nope. That's just not me.\n\nLast year, we implemented a system called EOS (Entrepreneur's Operating System) in one of my companies. I was skeptical—another management fad promising to fix everything. But to my surprise, it worked.\n\nIn fact, it's made me happier at work than I've been in decades.\n\nEOS leans into what founders actually are: manic chaos agents bursting with ideas. The \"screw it, let's do it\" types. It says every great company needs two roles: a visionary and an integrator.\n\nThe visionary sets direction and ideas. The integrator makes them happen—turning chaos into order, creating structure, and driving execution.

often they have turned down some post college job offer to do this business with you. Their friends are starting to make money. They must feel they are winning, not just see they're winning on a financial statement. That's just a number. They need it to hit their bank account.\n\nI've always noticed people's behavior change towards profit when they directly benefit from it.\n\nEquity Based on Shared Risk and Outcomes\r\nFor a business started from zero, I think it's a requirement to give a co-founder equity. But a critical mistake is forgetting reverse vesting and tying it to results.\n\nI've had many businesses where I start something, give a co-founder 30%, then they leave 6 months later after adding no value. Reverse vesting plus the option to buy them out if they leave is critical. Remember: every % given up = a % of all future profits for life.

is a famous line by Warren Buffett—someone many of us have modeled our lives after.\n\nThis advice, while valuable in moderation, became toxic when I took it to the extreme.\n\nAfter reading it, I became obsessed with how I came across to others.\n\nI thought that everyone—online and off—had to walk away from every interaction liking me.\n\nOne negative article, one misstatement, one failed commitment, and I'd be toast.\n\nI had to do exactly what I said and follow through. My behavior had to be consistent and predictable.\n\nAfter all, that's how a reputation is built. Brick by boring brick. Until one day, you die, honorable and forgotten forever.\n\nThis idea crystallized one afternoon at a pub with my dad.

always wanted to build your own buildings,\" I said, taking a sip of my beer. \"Why not become a real estate developer? With all your contacts, you could get up and running in no time.\"\n\n\"Andrew,\" he replied, leaning back in his chair. \"Once people put you in a mental box, they punish you for leaving it. In their minds, I'm in the 'architect' box. If I suddenly called them up and pitched a real estate development, it would hurt me more than starting fresh. Everyone hates it when you change boxes.\"\n\nMy stomach dropped—I knew he was right. I'd felt it a million times, though I hadn't quite put my finger on why.\n\nNothing made me cringe harder than the restaurateur friend pitching me on his tech startup.

is particularly hypocritical given how often I want to flip flop through everything myself: hobbies, businesses, communities, opinions—you name it. I hate in others what I secretly hate about myself.\n\nWe're all desperate to put one another in these boxes. I often get labeled \"investor\" or \"entrepreneur\". But even within that, there are sub-boxes. Tech investor, not real estate. Software businesses, not physical products. Bootstrapped, not venture. Crypto skeptic vs. crypto bull. Each label becomes another bar on the cage.\n\nDavid Solomon runs Goldman Sachs, but when word got out that he DJs on weekends?

all prison guards, basically. Making sure everyone stays in their assigned cells.\n\nWhy? Because our brains are prediction machines. They get upset when people behave in a manner that doesn't meet their predictions. Thus, step out of your box, and people (and their brains) won't like it.\n\nThere are people who know me based on my public business persona. They know me as a Buffett wannabe, building a holding company using value investing principles.\n\nThis is true. But I also love learning by jumping into random new projects that don't fit this mold.\n\nMy portfolio includes all sorts of businesses that would give Warren Buffett hives. I've lost my shirt starting restaurants. Acquired failing newspapers.

am both a disciplined value investor and a creator of chaotic startups across dozens of industries. These two things aren't supposed to coexist.\n\nIt's not just me. I recently polled a group of close friends and asked them what they would do for work if they couldn't do their current job.\n\nA friend runs a huge industrial holding company, but he told me that if nobody was watching, he'd sell it and start his own restaurant.\n\nAnd better yet, he wouldn't just be the owner. He'd be the chef, sweating it out behind an oven in the back.\n\nHis true, authentic passion is cooking, but he feels like he could never step out of the life and reputation he'd established for

Option 1: Hide and say nothing. Fly under the radar. Be a cipher. (Impossible, for an extreme extrovert like me.)\n\nTerrible Option 2: Become a caricature of myself. A personal brand instead of a person. Avoid doing anything controversial.\n\nTerrible Option 3: Live a double life. Perform one thing and do another in secret. The world wouldn't catch on and give me the corresponding social beating, but I also wouldn't get to share my passion with others.\n\nFor a long time, I chose Terrible Option 3. I toned down the things I mentioned publicly and didn't talk about many of my projects because they didn't fit the template.\n\nIt felt inauthentic.

people is the price of an authentic life.\n\nLet someone down today. Say the thing that's been rotting in your chest.\n\nStart small. Post your anime fan fiction. Tell your gym bros you love Pilates.\n\nThen, go bigger. End the relationship everyone thinks is perfect but is actually miserable. Admit what you thought was your dream job is a nightmare. Tell your business partner you want out. Stop pretending you enjoy the thing that's slowly killing you.\n\nWatch what happens: 90% won't notice or care. 8% will respect you more. 2% will hate you.\n\nBecause here's what I learned: The cage only exists if you believe in the bars.\n\nI'd rather have 2% hate the real me than 100% applaud a performance.\n\nPS: Thanks to all you hate-scrollers.

still buzzing. I recently described the feeling to a friend as a \"low grade MDMA high that lasted for 3 days\". Everyone gelled perfectly, we got lucky with the weather and logistics, and most importantly, we packed the room with 150 fascinating people from the worlds of science, comedy, business, and philanthropy.\n\nIt was easily our best one yet. I'll write more about it soon, but in the meantime, here's a few highlights:\n\nDan Mangan making me cry like a baby (and delivering one of the best live performances I've ever seen - check out his new album, it's beautiful)\r\nAlex Forman and Nash Park ruthlessly roasting my friend Julien when he revealed he owns a Jurassic Park themed jeep\r\nWill Mannon opening for Hannibal Buress… in Mandarin\r\nDoing a sauna session with Sauna Royalty, Dr. Rhonda Patrick and Dr. Ashley Mason\r\nMatthew Dicks explaining the best way to punch someone (through their head)\r\nLearning to write Onion headlines with Scott Dikkers\r\nJon Glaser reading letters that revealed that his dead dad was In Z.Z. Top (the book he wrote about it is hilarious and his new comedy album almost made me crash my car from laughing so hard)\r\nMe and my brother dropping to our knees to do a Wayne and Garth style \"We're Not Worthy!\" when we met Bill Oakley\r\nI honestly can't believe how well it went.

of events, I'm hosting one for lonely conglomerateurs (yes, that's a word 🤢, and if you ever want to get punched in the face, introduce yourself as one).\n\nThere are tons of support groups for executives and CEOs, but none for folks who run holding companies. It's a unique role with a rare structure and set of challenges.\n\nFrankly, it can be pretty isolating because there are so few people who can relate to our problems (of which there are many: perverse incentives, compensation negotiations, reporting complexities, etc).\n\nIn fact, I so rarely meet people who I can talk to about these problems with that I had to start my own event. It turns out, there are dozens of us!\n\nI hosted the first Conglomerateurs meetup in May in Vancouver, and it was incredible. We assembled a collection representing hundreds of companies and many billions of dollars in revenue across the group.

My friend Matteo asked to send me his mattress gadget. I didn't want it.\n\nI knew it would end up rotting in my basement with all the other expensive health tech, next to my Theragun, red-light therapy panel, and infrared-sauna blanket.\n\nI guarantee you've heard of Matteo's company: Eight Sleep.\n\nEvery podcaster won't shut up about it. It's a temperature-controlled mattress pad that supposedly optimizes your sleep.\n\nBut I thought it was unnecessary. I blast my AC at arctic levels and the idea of a water-filled pad on my bed seemed like a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nSo, when the box arrived, I ignored it for three months.\n\nAfter his fourth follow-up, guilt won out. I explained to Zoe that he'd sent it, and it was expensive so we had to try it.\n\nShe was unimpressed.

first night, I didn't notice much. But to my surprise, Zoe loved it.\n\nFor years she'd been waking up in the middle of the night, too hot or too cold, tossing and turning for hours. The Eight Sleep had automatically adjusted her temperature all night and prevented it.\n\nIt turns out that women's hormonal cycles cause wild temperature fluctuations during sleep, and Eight Sleep tunes your side of the bed based on your age and gender.\n\nIt's pretty cool. It learns your patterns and preferences, then adjusts accordingly—cooling for deep sleep, warming for REM, then gently heating to wake you up in the morning.\n\nFor me, it took three weeks to notice the benefits. But then I discovered something that might have saved my relationship: the sleep tracking showed exactly when and how much I snored.","title":"Eight Sleep Review\r\n\"I want to send you something I'm

The Beatles\r\nI've been rediscovering The Beatles.\n\nI was fourteen and I'd just gotten a Sony Discman. On the way out the door, I grabbed an interesting looking CD case with four shaggy-headed dudes on it from my parents' music collection and threw it into my backpack.\n\nI pushed the shiny disc into the player, threw on my headphones, and listened to the album straight through as I gazed out the window on a sunny drive to a cabin we'd rented for the summer.\n\nIt instantly clicked. The perfect album, and one I've listened to hundreds of times since.\n\nOver the past few days, I've been devouring John & Paul: A Love Story in Songs, Ian Leslie's wonderful new book about the relationship between John Lennon and Paul McCartney. If you're into The Beatles, or even just interested in how creativity happens, it's a great read.

I've been driving around blasting I'm Looking Through You, which, beneath the psychedelic riffs, captures McCartney's painful realization that his girlfriend had fundamentally changed: that the person he'd fallen for was no longer the same person sitting across from him. I'd been listening to this song for decades without even knowing what it was about.\n\nTrust me on this one: if you like The Beatles, read this book.\n\nMore importantly, if you don't like The Beatles, then this needs to be rectified ASAP. Stop what you're doing and listen to Rubber Soul all the way through, otherwise we can't be friends.\n\nRandom Stuff:\r\nThe new Naked Gun movie is absolutely hilarious. I think it's the first movie I've seen in theaters with my sons (6 and 8) where we all laughed our heads off together. Akiva Shaffer (The Lonely Island), the director, never fails to bust my guts. Trailer\r\nI enjoyed this conversation with my friend Lydia Chen on her podcast Escape 9 to 5. You can listen to it on Spotify.\r\nMessages are ruining my life. Hundreds a day and they're split across iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, and Slack and having to jump between all those apps to keep the notifications at bay stresses the hell out of me. But not anymore, thanks to Beeper. It's like Superhuman for texts and combines all of these services into one insanely fast, keyboard-driven interface. So good.\r\nNerdy Finance Question: I need a venture fund admin service to mark all our investments + manage day-to-day operations + track investor updates for my 150 or so personal venture investments + the Tiny Rolling Fund. Who's the best? Would love some recommendations. Email Ben if you know someone great.\r\nI'm hiring a full-time AI automation nerd to work with me to help me with personal automations + some workflows within my various businesses. You: eat, live, and breathe Lindy, Airtable, and the like. Have never seen a task you can't automate. Are insanely high paced and obsessed with AI. Email me examples (ideally in a Loom) of some of the cool automations you've built. FULL-TIME ONLY, with a three-month contract to start.\r\nVictoria Stuff:\r\nA nice new restaurant opened in Oak Bay. It's called Liv Bistro. I've been for dinner a few times and been impressed. Check it out.\r\nNeed a personal trainer? Talk to my trainer, Tameer. He's a competitive powerlifter, super down-to-earth (critical for a trainer), and he comes to your home (huge time saver). He has a few spots opening for new clients.\r\nIf you like Vietnamese food, I'm hooked on Original Pho.

A little poke, a second of discomfort.​\r\n​\r\nNo going back now. My palms started gushing sweat.\r\n​\r\n​I lay down on the couch and the nurse passed me an eye mask and a pair of noise-cancelling headphones. I slipped them on while she checked my vitals one last time.\r\n​\r\nThen darkness.\r\n​\r\nNothing.\r\n​\r\nMinutes crawled by as I listened to the pulse of mellow electronic music and forced myself to breathe.\r\n​\r\nWhy did I agree to this, I wondered. I hated drugs.\r\n​\r\nI flashed back to that unexpected hug outside my kids’ school.\r\n​\r\nA few months before, I had run into my friend Faisal at school drop-off. He walked right over to me, beaming, and gave me a massive bear hug.\r\n​\r\nThis caught me off guard. It was totally out of character. After all, Faisal doesn't hug. He barely shakes hands. He’s the very definition of nonplussed. Always calm, quiet, and controlled—sometimes with a touch of melancholy.\r\n​\r\nNow, he seemed like a new man. Bright, expressive, and suddenly…a hugger?\r\n​\r\nAs I thought back to this moment, lying on the brown couch in the clinic, a minute after my injection, I started sinking.\r\n​\r\nDeeper and deeper.\r\n​\r\nNot into the couch, but through it. The music warped, stretching around me like taffy. My body felt heavy, then weightless, then…just gone.\r\n​\r\nI melted into something warm and formless. Like my body was dissolving, spreading like cake batter across space.\r\n​\r\nThen, a few moments later, I died.\r\n​\r\nAt least that's what it felt like.\r\n​\r\nThe injection I had just received was a drug called ketamine, and it had transformed Faisal’s life. I was wondering if it could do the same for me.\r\n​\r\nAfter battling depression for over 35 years, a single injection of ketamine had taken Faisal from managed melancholy to joyous and thriving in a matter of hours.\r\n​\r\nHis depression had lifted completely. For the first time in decades, he felt light. Free of his mental shackles.\r\n​\r\nAfter witnessing his transformation, I went down a rabbit hole of research.\r\n​\r\nHow could this be?\r\n​\r\nWe all know that psychedelics had their moment in the ‘60s. Hippies. Timothy Leary. Turn on, tune in, drop out. The summer of love.\r\n​\r\nThen, Altamont and Charles Manson. The government quickly freaked out and banned it all, and for forty years, nobody could even study them.\r\n​\r\nFifteen years ago, a few brave scientists at Johns Hopkins and NYU decided to risk their careers and start running trials again. They figured if these drugs were so dangerous, the data would show it.\r\n​\r\nNot only did the data show that they were safe, but the results have been nothing short of remarkable.\r\n​\r\nJohns Hopkins found that 80% of cancer patients showed significant reductions in depression and anxiety after a single psilocybin session—effects that lasted six months.\r\n​\r\nAnother study showed that 67% of PTSD patients no longer qualified for the diagnosis after three MDMA sessions.\r\n​\r\nWilder still, with small doses of ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, people whose lives had been destroyed by crippling depression were walking out of clinics crying tears of relief after a single hour-long session.\r\n​\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), drugs like Prozac and Cipralex have rescued many from depression and anxiety. I know this from personal experience (I’ve taken Vortioxetine for five years, and it has changed my life). But for many, they leave lingering symptoms, and for some, they don’t work at all. These were the people that ketamine seemed to help most — those who had tried everything else, then experienced a miracle.\r\n​\r\nBefore my friend Faisal found antidepressants, it was so bad he sometimes couldn’t leave his bed and, at times, even contemplated ending his life. SSRIs had saved him, but they were not completely effective. While he was able to function on them, he still didn't feel like he was at his best. The symptoms were managed, not gone.\r\n​\r\nBut after ketamine, he said that he felt his depression symptoms were nonexistent, and stayed that way for months after treatment.\r\n​\r\nFaisal's transformation amazed me so much that I decided I had to try it.\r\n​\r\nBut I wasn't depressed. My thing has always been anxiety.\r\n​\r\nYou know that feeling when you're nervous and your palms feel like there’s electric current running through them? That tight feeling in your chest, like you can’t get enough air to relax?\r\n​\r\nThat's me, 24/7—usually for no good reason.\r\n​\r\nMy brain is a cruel master, constantly warning of looming doom in my health, business, or family if I don't act RIGHT NOW.\r\n​\r\nSure, I had moments of calm presence, looking in the rearview mirror, reflecting on past concerns, wondering what I was so stressed about. But it rarely lasted long, and poor sleep, work stress, and a busy life frequently caused my anxiety to boil over.\r\n​\r\nAs they had for Faisal, taking SSRIs had made a profound difference and turned the volume down on my anxiety, but I was curious if ketamine could provide more lasting relief.\r\n​\r\nTo be honest though, I was vaguely terrified of psychedelics. They scared the hell out of me. I’d sworn off recreational drug use years ago, after a five-gram psilocybin mushroom trip that left me wrecked for months.\r\n​\r\nThe way I put it to a friend was:\r\n​\r\n​\"When I do mushrooms, it feels like I'm in a hedge maze, and four out of five routes contain a clown with a chainsaw.”​\r\n​\r\nSo, as you can imagine, I was nervous as hell to try ketamine. But as I researched it more deeply, I was comforted by a few things:\r\n​\r\n- It only lasts an hour.\r\n​\r\n- It has a much lower incidence of “bad trips.” Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic, not a classic psychedelic. Users often feel detached from their body/emotions and can gain perspective (rather than confronting the killer clowns directly 😂).\r\n​\r\n- It’s administered in a clinical setting. There's a whole process: doctors’ referrals, psychological screening, medical evaluations, therapy and integration. This is actual medicine, administered by actual doctors and nurses who monitor your vitals and can intervene if anything goes wrong.\r\n​\r\n- It’s remarkably safe. It's been used as an anesthetic in hospitals for over 50 years—they even give it to kids having surgery. Unlike other drugs, you can't really overdose on it, and it doesn't suppress your breathing or heart rate.\r\n​\r\nSo, I gulped and signed up for a session at a local ketamine clinic.\r\n​\r\nBack on the couch that day, tripping balls, something big shifted inside of me.\r\n​\r\nIt felt like I was being dissolved.\r\n​\r\nBroken down into individual atoms.\r\n​\r\nThat I no longer existed.\r\n​\r\nThat I had died, and this was the in-between space between life and death.\r\n​\r\nThis sounds scary, but oddly, it wasn’t. It felt calm and peaceful. Like I’d zoomed out on life and the thing I feared most wasn’t so scary after all.\r\n​\r\nWhat I experienced during the trips was so abstract that it’s difficult to describe, but here are a few things I experienced/felt.\r\n​\r\nAt one point I had a vision of a nuclear bomb blast approaching me. The blast wave rushed toward me, incinerating everything in its path. I should have been terrified, but I wasn't. Just before impact, it stopped. An invisible dome surrounded me and my family and friends.\r\n​\r\nThe realization: me and my loved ones. It was us against the world.\r\n​\r\nI had this feeling: Keep them safe, and everything will be fine. That it was all that mattered.\r\n​\r\nLater, new images flooded in. Memories I hadn't touched in decades surfaced.\r\n​\r\nOne struck me hard.\r\n​\r\nI was eight years old. My friend and I had tricked my younger brother into a wooden box. We slammed the lid and sat on top. His screams echoed from inside, his small fists pounding against the wood. Muffled terror.\r\n​\r\nLying there in the clinic, thirty years later, I felt tears stream down my face. I felt his panic, his betrayal. I'd been angry at someone else but took it out on him—the weakest target available.\r\n​\r\nI felt a deep sense of shame wash over me.\r\n​\r\nEach session lasted an hour but felt like weeks. As the ketamine wore off, I'd surface slowly, pulling off the eye mask to find myself back in the beige clinic room, saying \"Wow...\" over and over, like a tripped-out Owen Wilson.\r\n​\r\nI called my brother right after and apologized for what happened when we were kids—something I'd been carrying around for thirty years like a sharp pebble in my shoe. While he could barely remember it, he appreciated the apology.\r\n​\r\nThis phone call—something I might have felt but never been able to say—was particularly interesting. And I’ve made many more similar calls after the sessions since.\r\n​\r\nAfter wrapping four treatments, I've been struggling to describe the experience.\r\n​\r\nI told a friend about it over coffee the other day, and I sounded like a lunatic.\r\n​\r\n\"It felt like I got melted down into cake batter, then spread all over the world,\" I told him, watching his face contort with concern. “And like…nothing really matters except your friends and family.”\r\n​\r\nSee, this is the problem with trying to describe a high-dose psychedelic experience. It all sounds completely insane and unrelatable. You end up sounding like that guy at the party who corners you to explain his ayahuasca breakthrough while you slowly back toward the exit.\r\n​\r\nThe imagery and the experience can sound trite. The insights don’t seem that deep. Like, I get it, focus on friends and family. Do you really need to trip balls to find this out?\r\n​\r\nBut what's profound about ketamine isn't the wild visuals or the feeling of becoming one with the universe. It's the emotional processing that happens while you're in that altered state.\r\n​\r\nAfter my first session, it felt like I’d done ten years of therapy compressed into an hour.\r\n​\r\nThere were emotional wounds I'd been carrying for decades—resentments, frustrations, hurt, many from childhood. After a single session, feelings that had been a screaming 10 out of 10 on the pain scale suddenly felt like a manageable 2.\r\n​\r\nLike the sharp edges had been sanded down.\r\n​\r\nWe don't yet know the exact mechanism of how ketamine achieves this, but scientists believe it works in several ways.\r\n​\r\nYour ego temporarily dissolves, so you can examine your life and problems without your usual defensive barriers getting in the way.\r\n​\r\nThe altered state lets you access memories and emotions that might normally be buried or avoided. Your brain's usual filtering system goes offline, so repressed stuff can bubble up and be processed. It felt safe to peek into the dark and scary closets and go skeleton hunting—thoughts I might otherwise keep locked away.\r\n​\r\nThere's also a direct neurochemical effect that provides immediate relief from depression and anxiety symptoms.\r\n​\r\nBut most importantly, ketamine opens what scientists call a \"neuroplasticity window.\"\r\n​\r\nThink of your brain like a ski hill. Your thoughts are skiers taking the same runs over and over, carving deeper grooves. Depression and anxiety? Those are the icy moguls you can't avoid. Ketamine dumps fresh powder on the whole mountain. You can interrupt and replace old, destructive thought patterns.\r\n​\r\nSo many of us crave annual trips away—a reset, a change of perspective. To me, ketamine felt like a multi-week pilgrimage for my mind, at a fraction of the time and cost.\r\n​\r\nEach time I pulled off the sleep mask, just an hour later, I felt like I'd gotten back from a three-week trip, wandering through the Himalayas, finding myself. Something had shifted deep inside of me, in the best possible way.\r\n​\r\nIt's been profound in a way that no amount of talk therapy has ever been able to achieve. It helped me work through deeper issues and little traumas that had been bothering me since I was a teenager.\r\n​\r\nWhile it hasn't cured my anxiety (I'm still on an SSRI, and unlike Faisal, I didn't experience a major effect on my symptoms), it has allowed me to let go of some of my most unwieldy and unpleasant pieces of emotional baggage.\r\n​\r\nThe result has been a deeper sense of peace and something I've always wanted: a deep, indescribable sense that everything will be ok.\r\n​\r\nWho knew that all it would take was being melted into cake batter?\r\n​\r\nOf course, it's not a panacea. In the time since my treatments, I've had many moments of anxiety and existential angst. For me, it was more deep therapy than a biological fix.\r\n​\r\nHere's what surprised me most: I had zero desire to do it again anytime soon.\r\n​\r\nRemember that three-week Himalayan trek I mentioned? That's exactly what it feels like. Not something I’d want to do regularly.\r\n​\r\nYes, ketamine can be addictive if you start taking it every time you go dancing. But in clinical settings with proper protocols, addiction is extremely rare. This isn't a party drug experience. It's deep work that leaves you feeling like you just climbed Everest and need to process for a while. Most people do an initial 4-6 sessions, then maybe a booster every few months or years.\r\n​\r\nI’ve kind of given up on trying to explain the experience. How do you tell someone you became cake batter and found enlightenment? That you died and were reborn four times for the price of a weekend vacation? That an hour lying on a brown couch did what a decade of talk therapy couldn't?\r\n​\r\nFor now, I’m just telling people that, if they struggle with depression, PTSD, or anxiety, they should try it themselves.\r\n​\r\nIf you want to deep dive on ketamine in general, I'd recommend listening to Tim Ferriss's four-hour episode on ketamine with Dr. John Krystal from Yale, who's one of the leading researchers in ketamine's clinical applications. It's been shown to be most effective for treatment-resistant depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, chronic pain, and certain addiction issues.\r\n​\r\nIf you're interested in trying it, there are reputable clinics sprouting up in most major cities. I did it at SabiMind here in Victoria and had a great experience.\r\n​\r\nI also recognize this isn’t yet accessible for everyone. A full course of treatment can run a few thousand dollars, and most insurance doesn't cover it yet. After experiencing firsthand how life-changing this can be, I want to pay it forward.\r\n​\r\nI’d like to cover the full cost of treatment for three people in Victoria who are struggling with treatment-resistant depression or anxiety but can't afford ketamine therapy. If that's you, email me your story by responding to this email. I'll pick three people, and all I ask in return is that you let me share your experience if you end up getting treatment (anonymized if you prefer).\r\n​\r\nGodspeed 🪄🎂🤯\r\n​\r\n​Note: This is my personal experience.

got 30,000 people to watch a video about…paper?​\r\n​\r\nHere's what you need to know about business school students: within thirty seconds of walking into a classroom, you can predict who will actually start a business and who will end up as a bureaucrat in corporate finance.\r\n​\r\nChris and I recently spoke to a class of local business students at the University of Victoria. As we spoke, I looked out at a sea of faces, most staring blankly—the telltale sign of kids who are there because their parents pressured them into it or because \"business\" looks respectable on a resume. I felt a bit let down.\r\n​\r\nBut afterwards, two students walked up to me and started peppering me with questions—the kind that immediately told me they were entrepreneurs. Their names were Aiden and Hiroko.\r\n​\r\nThey told me that as a side hustle, they had started doing social media for local businesses and had recently landed a contract with The Papery, one of my favorite local shops. It sells ornate letterpress cards, beautiful wrapping paper, and Japanese fountain pens that cost a small fortune. It’s the sort of place that shouldn't survive in the Amazon era, but whose cult following keeps it alive. It turned out that these two had played a part in that, and were now promoting it on Instagram.\r\n​\r\nI was even more impressed when they told me that one of the video reels they made got over 30,000 views.\r\n​\r\nThink about that for a moment: for a small local store with zero ad budget in a city with 250,000 people, that's the equivalent of getting one in eight residents to stop scrolling and watch your content. The video was a behind-the-scenes look at the store, exploring its history and operations. This piqued my interest.\r\n​\r\nSo, when they asked me to grab coffee later that week, I said yes immediately.\r\n​\r\nAt coffee, they showed me their work—clean, professional photography, copywriting, and design with an eye for detail that most agencies lack, plus a solid grasp of business fundamentals that's rare for students. They knew their numbers and were opinionated. Both were obviously driven and hardworking. But they had something that is rare and impossible to teach: great taste.\r\n​\r\nWhat really won me over was their pace. Within a few hours of brainstorming, they started emailing me ideas and proposals. There's a particular type of person who operates like this and I've learned to pay attention to this signal. There's a saying in carpentry: measure twice, cut once. Most people just never stop measuring. They cut.\r\n​\r\nI told them that I owned a bunch of local businesses that needed help, and knew of dozens more. The agencies I'd used in the past either want you to dump huge sums into Facebook ads (not feasible for small businesses) or produce content that makes you cringe (embarrassing!). There was, I told them, a big opportunity for someone to build an agency that could build legions of fans around local businesses by telling their stories.\r\n​\r\nStories that explain how that amazing corner bakery makes their extra crunchy double-baked almond croissants. Or how much effort goes into sourcing the incredible ingredients from local farms. Or the history of the business—what went into building what customers see today.\r\n​\r\nWe started brainstorming, and a partnership structure came together over the course of the week: they bring the creative talent and execution, while I help them scale, provide financial backing, and open doors to bigger clients. A perfect match. I get to turn what used to be a business expense into a revenue stream, while helping two hungry entrepreneurs move faster than they could alone.\r\n​\r\nAnd just like that, we started an agency together.\r\n​\r\nIt’s called download, and we're helping independent businesses get the attention they deserve by telling their unique stories.\r\n​\r\nThink tasteful posts, reels and TikToks showcasing what makes each business special: behind the scenes looks.

was left feeling unsettled by this Diary of a CEO interview with Geoffrey Hinton, who is largely credited for many of the academic breakthroughs in AI.\r\n​\r\nMy favorite quote:\r\n​\r\n​\"If you want to know what life's like when you're not the apex intelligence ask a chicken\"​\r\n​\r\nIgnore the clickbait title on the podcast. It’s actually a very calm and rational interview, but it’s fascinating to hear it from somebody who has been at the edge of this for a very long time and no longer has any skin in the game.\r\n​\r\n​Spotify / YouTube / Apple Podcasts​\r\n​\n\nSpeaking of starting agencies: running one is stressful as hell.​\r\n​\r\nEighteen years ago, I was burnt out from running Metalab, so I decided to go backpacking in Europe.\r\n​\r\nBeing an inexperienced fool, I decided to hand off the operations to one of my best friends from college, Mark Nichols.\r\n​\r\nAt the time, he had no experience running a business—in fact, his only job experience at the time was mopping floors at a Starbucks in a Burlington strip mall—and I did a very poor job of onboarding him.\r\n​\r\nI let him listen in on a few client calls, showed him how I sent invoices and estimates, and introduced him to a few of my contractors.\r\n​\r\nThen, I disappeared, telling him to only call if there was a true emergency.\r\n​\r\nLong story short, there wasn’t. And Mark really ran Metalab after that.\r\n​\r\nHe turned out to be amazing at running agencies, and quickly grew the business from a four-person studio working with fledgling startups, to an internationally renowned firm with a roster of Fortune 500 clients.\r\n​\r\nHe is THE MAN, and remarkably, he’s still one of my best friends, even after working together for decades.\r\n​\r\nNow, being the grizzled veteran that he is, he finally got fed up with everyone asking him how to run an agency and wrote a book about it.\r\n​\r\nIt’s called You’re On Your Own. I read a bunch of early versions, and it’s great. If you run an agency, it’s required reading.\r\n​\r\nIf you run a services business, or are thinking about starting one, you should go buy Mark’s book here.\r\n​\r\n​PS: Metalab just did some insanely beautiful work.\r\n​\r\nThey just rebranded Windsurf, one of the top AI coding platforms, which just sold to OpenAI for $3 billion. I absolutely love this rebrand.\r\n​\r\nThis comes on the heels of work for Suno, Pika, Grok, and MidJourney 💪\r\n​","title":"June 30, 2025","date":"June 30,

hometown, Victoria, used to buzz.​\r\n​\r\nFrom 2008 to 2018, you could feel the energy building. Great shows, incredible events, a city coming alive.\r\n​\r\nThen COVID hit. And frankly, we’ve been in a bit of a funk ever since.\r\n​\r\nDon’t get me wrong—there are still some amazing event organizers doing incredible work here. But their numbers are dwindling. Many of the people who used to bring fantastic performers and mid-sized acts to town have shut down or sold to faceless corporate groups.\r\n​\r\nHere’s the thing: Victoria is packed with talent and potential. But there’s always been this barrier—you want to book that comedian everyone’s talking about, or bring in that band, or throw an epic party, but you need a huge deposit upfront. Too much risk for one person to shoulder alone.\r\n​\r\nSo my friend Josh Franklin and I decided to do something about it.\r\n​\r\nWe’re launching The Culture Fund.\r\n​\r\nWe’re offering loans between $1,000–$50,000 to help people put on incredible events that make Victoria better.\r\n​\r\nMusic shows. Comedy nights. Festivals. Massive parties. Whatever makes this city more vibrant.\r\n​\r\nHere’s the deal: This isn’t charity. We’re trying to stimulate a sustainable arts, culture, and music scene. The city doesn’t benefit if these events fail financially. So we’re going to be disciplined about it. The numbers need to make sense.

robot-induced cat feces trauma is over.​\r\n​\r\nIn my book, I shared a funny story about how a rogue robot vacuum once smeared cat feces throughout my house:\r\n​\r\n​\"When I staggered back through the front door of my house, I was hit with a smell so foul it made my eyes water. The whole house reeked like a pit latrine. Gripping my nose, I walked down the hall and into my dining room. Then, I saw something I can never unsee. It appeared that my cat didn’t share my fine taste in furniture and litter boxes. The sand in the box was left untouched, and in the hours since I’d left, she had defecated all over the floor around it. My robot vacuum, on its nightly schedule, had smeared a thin layer of cat feces across the room in a circular pattern, like a Franz Kline painting, and the little Roomba was now beeping shamefully in the corner.”​\r\n​\r\nWell, I’m a glutton for punishment. I’ve since tried 2-3 more robot vacuums, and while I’ve never experienced this level of depravity again, none of them have worked very well. They almost always got tangled on cords or stuck under things, and I ended up spending as much time managing them than I otherwise would have vacuuming manually.\r\n​\r\nI recently bought one that I absolutely love. It’s called the Matic and it was built by two Google engineers. It’s basically a mini self-driving car, with full machine vision, and can avoid any objects left on the ground.\r\n​\r\nIt’s incredible, and it mops and sweeps our house each night.\r\n​\r\nMy

a fan, and speaking from experience (🤢), I give it a big thumbs up. Check out the Matic robot vacuum here​\r\n​\n\nThe Verge just called our absurd $3,600 keyboard \"the best.\"​\r\n​\r\nA few months ago, I wrote about an investment we made in Norbauer & Co—my old friend Ryan Norbauer’s company that makes luxury keyboards that cost more than most computers. (You can read the full story here - it’s a fun one.)\r\n​\r\nWell, The Verge just published their review of his masterpiece, the Seneca.\r\n​\r\nTheir verdict?\r\n​\r\n​\"The best, and most expensive, thing I’ve ever typed on.\"​\r\n​\r\nThe reviewer, Nathan Edwards, goes on to say:\r\n​\r\n​“The more normal you are about keyboards, the less impressive the Seneca is. I am not normal about keyboards, and the Seneca is goddamn incredible.”\r\n​\r\n\"For lack of a better word, the Seneca feels permanent.\"\r\n​\r\n\"The typing experience is sublime.\"​\r\n​\r\nAnd no

started posting more on Instagram. Follow me at @awilkinson​\r\n​\r\nI spent many years of my childhood cackling at Tom Green’s antics on a grainy television in my parent’s basement.​\r\n​\r\nI just watched This Is The Tom Green Documentary, which, as you would guess by the name, is a documentary about Tom Green’s rise from small-town Canadian cable access fame, to Hollywood, and back. I found it insanely nostalgic and laughed a lot. Trailer / Letterboxd​\r\n​\r\nA few weeks ago, Chris and I shared Tiny’s 2024 Annual Letter, where we walked through what we’ve been up to over the last year.​\r\n​\r\nTLDR: Our cost-cutting program led to a 38% QoQ jump in Q4 Adjusted EBITDA, while recurring revenue is up 4x since 2021. We also acquired a 66% stake in Serato for $66M, which is expected to boost earnings by approximately 45%.\r\n​\r\nYou can read the full letter here.\r\n​\r\nA lovely guy from Italy named Giulio Michelon flew out to interview me for his podcast.​\r\n​\r\nIt turned out really well. We talked about:\r\n​\r\n- Why agencies are so stressful (he has one too)\r\n- Why I still feel “Never Enough,” even after writing a book about it\r\n- How incentives make or break companies\r\n​\r\nAnd a bunch more. Spotify / YouTube / Apple Podcasts​\r\n​\r\nWe’re still looking to hire someone to manage our local events. Through my personal network and businesses, we host a ton of speakers, lunch and learns, forums, and conferences, and we’re adding to our events team.​\r\n​\r\n​We’re looking for someone who is: a big people person, has incredible taste (aesthetics + you know all the best spots in Vancouver/Victoria), and ideally some event planning experience.\r\n​\r\nYou can be early in your career—this is one of those rare roles where we’re willing to hire for potential vs. experience.

I finally gave up on humans for these sorts of rote tasks. I freed my assistants to focus on the high level stuff and built a robot to tackle my email.\n\nLately, I’ve been obsessed with this tool called ​Lindy​ that lets you create AI assistants. With it, you can make your own digital Rube Goldberg machines to complete almost any digital task, hooking up AI models to all the services you use (Gmail, Google Drive, Twilio, HubSpot—you name it) and having AI do things on your behalf. This could be as simple as sending you a text with a brief on the person you’re about to meet, or as complex as a 20-step automation that writes email newsletters for you (don’t worry, I wrote this by

emails I do need to see, it applies a label: Logistics, Kids, Events, Homes, Book, whatever.\n\n- Kid's school emails get auto-added to my calendar with reminders (permission slips, field trips, stuff I need to pack, etc)—this one is a total game changer\n\n- Anything needing my signature gets sent to my legal counsel, receipts go to accounting\n\n- When someone reaches out wanting to sell their company or offering an investment, the AI will actually do a quick background check - who is this person? Are they legit? Does this seem dubious? If yes, instant archive. If no, it gets flagged to me to respond.\n\n- Does it seem time sensitive? If yes, it adds an ASAP flag.\n\nMy inbox is the cleanest it's been in years and I’m adding to the automation daily. So. Freaking.

you don’t remember, last month I started bragging about my friends.\n\n‍This time, I want to take a minute to brag about my friend Janene Scordo.\n\n‍I’ve never met anyone like her. She’s one of the most intensely driven and brutally honest people I know.\n\nI liked her the moment we met: she has that rare and wonderful quality of blurting out the thing that everyone else is thinking but is too chicken to say. Flash forward years later and she’s often the first person to tell me when I’m doing something dumb. She’s true blue and one of my best friends.\n\nIn her twenties she worked in finance, but after leaving her job to have two kids, she was going stir crazy, languishing in 24/7 kid life. She kept talking my ear off about wanting to buy a business, so I introduced her to Sarah Hunter, a talented designer friend who wanted to sell her agency to start a new business.","title":"‍“Work

knew less than nothing about running a design agency. She’d never used Figma and didn’t even know what CSS was. But she immediately jumped in and bought it.\n\nSince then, she has taken the business from a single employee to over a dozen, and grown revenue more than 5x, doing brand, web, and Shopify design and development for amazing companies like Left on Friday, WealthSimple, and our beloved AeroPress.\n\n‍1. Janene is really cool. If you’re an entrepreneur based in Vancouver or Victoria, you should ​email her​ and get coffee.\n\n2. You should hire ​her agency​. They're awesome and do great work (Shopify, Webflow, and branding in particular).\n\n3. She wants to buy another business.

in 2020, we raised a $150M USD fund. Chris and I were vaguely terrified — it was the first time we'd ever raised outside capital, other than letting friends co-invest in a few deals — but it ended up being perfect timing.\n\nFrom 2021-2024, almost all of our acquisitions happened in the fund. The additional capital allowed us to buy incredible businesses like AeroPress (the popular coffee maker) and Letterboxd (a social network for film buffs that just hit 20 million users). By late 2024, with those and a few other acquisitions, we'd fully deployed all $150M USD.\n\nThe problem? When we went public in 2023, this structure made it nearly impossible for our public company shareholders to understand what the hell we were up to. It looked like we stopped investing for three years, when in reality, we poured $38M of our own capital into the fund, which was owned by the public company but didn’t share its numbers.

short answer was that we were in a flurry of compounding, but it was all just happening inside this fund, creating a sort of financial \"black box\" that was impossible to understand from the outside.\n\nHere's how it works: Tiny Ltd (the public holding company) owns about 20% of the fund, plus we get 30% of the profits after our investors hit an 8% annualized return (this is called \"carry\" in investor-speak). But none of the fund’s revenue or earnings shows up in our financial statements. The only thing an investor would see is a $38M investment on our balance sheet.\n\nAfter over a year of back and forth and countless painstaking meetings with accountants, lawyers, and auditors, we

you break out the calculator: yes, that $1M is roughly 20% of the total distributions for the quarter, but also includes some of our carry. So you can do your own napkin math about how much cash these businesses are throwing off, but it won’t be perfectly accurate. Note: We're actively working on reporting more detailed fund metrics.\n\nGoing forward, the fund is wrapped and now it's just about seeing those investments through, capturing the upside, and cashflowing. All new acquisitions (like Serato, which I'll tell you more about in a moment) will happen directly in the public company, making everything much cleaner and easier to understand.","title":"Tiny's

use all three across various businesses and they are all great (with slightly different feature sets).\r\n‍\n\nI'm loving the new Lorne Michaels biography - It’s so good I find myself skipping all my favorite TV shows to read it every night. Aside from hearing all the saucy gossip and hilarious anecdotes about how he launched many of the world’s largest comedians (Mike Myers, Tina Fey, Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell, and dozens more), it’s a fascinating character study of a deeply complicated person. Bonus points: he's Canadian. Grab a copy here\r\n‍\r\nListen to me and Sam Corcos jam about our favorite Life Hacks - Sam is the best sort of lunatic. He tracks his time in 15-minute blocks, shares his home with another couple even though he’s rich, and has been \"news sober\" for 11 years. We discuss how your calendar reveals your true priorities and why AI might create more software developers, not fewer. Lots of fun ideas in here. Spotify / YouTube\r\n‍\r\nWe’re speaking in Victoria - Chris and I were flattered to receive UVic's Distinguished Entrepreneurs of the Year and there’s a big gala to celebrate on June 10th in Victoria. There will be a reception, dinner, and a fireside chat/Q&A. It’s usually a black tie event, but because we hate wearing suits, you can wear whatever you want. ​Grab tickets here\r\n‍\r\nThere are only 10 spots left for Interesting People - This is the conference ​I wish existed when I was younger​. No status games. No badge-glancing. Just 150 interesting people hanging out for 3 days. If you're a close friend and want to come, text me ASAP. Otherwise, ​apply here​.\r\n‍\r\nWe’re hiring an event coordinator - We’re looking for someone to help run my Interesting People event this July. You'll work with the team to handle all the ground-level details - food, venues, signs, transportation, guest needs. Perfect for someone who's run events before, communicates well under pressure, and knows Victoria. Ideally you're a foodie with great taste, love thoughtful design, know all the best spots in town, and thrive on details. Part-time leading up to the event, then all-in during. This could become a full-time role if it goes well, as we're now doing multiple events per year. Email ​monica@follypartners.com​ if this sounds like you (or you know someone).\r\n‍\r\nBuy my apartment -  I bought this stunning penthouse apartment in Vancouver and had my friend Kate Snyder and her team at ​Studio Roslyn​ turn it into something amazing. Unfortunately, with our busy life in Victoria, Zoe and I barely used it, and our plans to Airbnb got kiboshed when Vancouver changed their short-term rental laws.","title":"‍​Ramp​ - just launched in

bought it out of bankruptcy for $3.7M (the last sale was for well over $4M), and we recently listed it for $3.68M. It fully cash flows itself, but I don't like the logistics of managing real estate.\n\nWe ended up renting it to a wonderful elderly couple who are very happy there, and we don't want to move them, so our buyer has to be someone who wants to buy and hold a cash-flowing asset, with the possibility of potentially moving into it in the future.\n\nAlso: if you own an exceptional, cash flowing business, perhaps I could be persuaded to trade the apartment for equity ;-)\n\nIf anyone wants to buy a beautiful cash-flowing penthouse in Vancouver, ​check it out​.\r\n‍\n\n​Did you enjoy this newsletter?

you’re getting this: this is my Friends Newsletter, a brain dump of interesting things that I send to interesting people I've met and friends I want to stay in touch with. Zero pressure to stick around—just click unsubscribe if you don’t want to get it (don’t worry, I won’t be notified).\n\nLast month, I made $20,303 power washing driveways.\n\n‍There's a sentence I never thought I'd write. Here's how it happened.\n\nIt was a chilly October afternoon and I’d just finished speaking at a University of Victoria business school class. As usual, one of the eager beaver students (there’s always one) asked if he could walk me to my car.\n\nAs we walked, he gave a breathless elevator pitch on himself. His name was Andan, and a few years back he’d started a landscaping business in Calgary, hiring a bunch of his friends and paying his way through school.

would you waste your time with business school?” I asked, stating what I felt was obvious. “You’ve already run a business—you already know this stuff. Business school is for people who want to work at McKinsey. Just start a business and read books as you go.”\n\nHe hemmed and hawed. His parents. The money. All the usual excuses people have for not following their passion.\n\nI gave him my number, told him that if he wanted to start a business I’d back him, and drove away.\n\nI’ve said this sort of thing to dozens of business school students. I rarely hear from them again.\n\nBut this time, a couple hours later, I got the text: “Let’s do it. What should we start?”\n\nI grinned. I had recently read a draft of ​The Sweaty Startup​, my friend Nick Huber’s excellent new book on how to get rich by starting blue collar businesses, and pitched Andan on the idea of starting a

shook hands on a deal: me and my team would handle all the marketing, demand generation, and tech/workflows, and he’d run the business day-to-day and manage the team.\n\nOne month later, we launched ​PressurePros​. One of the places we promoted was on this very newsletter, and I wanted to say a huge thank you to all of you who promptly hired us to wash your driveways and patios (don’t forget to leave a 5-star review on Google!).\n\nI’m excited to report that in March, we did $20,303 in revenue and that number is scaling fast.\n\nAs you’d expect, Andan has been doing an incredible job, but he’s up to his eyeballs fielding sales calls, quoting, and hiring like crazy.\n\nWe're looking for incredible people to join our team. We need motivated folks for sales (handling calls, visiting sites, giving estimates) and hard workers for pressure washing jobs (landscaping experience is a bonus).

who invite me to fun gatherings and hangouts.\n\nTwo miraculous little boys who want all my attention.\n\n‍​The Kid Stays in The Picture by Robert Evans\r\nRobert Evans went from 50’s movie star to running Paramount Pictures during its Godfather heyday, only to fall flat on his face and go broke in the eighties. Pure Hollywood popcorn and full of fun (probably half-true) anecdotes about seemingly every celebrity of yesteryear.\n\n​When The Going Was Good by Graydon Carter​\r\nA memoir by Graydon Carter, the longtime editor of Vanity Fair. It’s a bit of a shock to read about just how incredible the magazine business used to be. Aside from lots of dishy gossip about various famous people and a great rags to riches story, this book is a grim reminder of how quickly the tides can change in business.

the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.\" —Paul Ehrlich\n\n‍Don’t get me wrong. Things are bad. But they’ve always been bad. And they’re much better than they used to be by almost every measure.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that it’s our job—at least those in my age group and up—to bemoan the next generation and state of the world. The kids are probably alright, and humans will probably still exist in 500 years.\r\n‍\n\n​Did you enjoy this newsletter?

35% compound annual growth rate on recurring revenue over the last five years\n\nSerato is exactly the kind of business we love: a category-defining brand with a deeply passionate user base and long runway ahead. The founders and team in Auckland have built something truly special over 25 years, and I'm thrilled they chose us as their long-term home.\n\nA warm welcome to AJ, Steve, Young, and the entire Serato team. We couldn't be more excited to have you join the Tiny family and we're looking forward to helping you take it to the next level.\n\n‍PS: As part of this announcement, Tiny's Q4 results were also just announced.

I also occasionally listen to terrifying true crime about children being abducted (most recently ​this one about Michael Dunahee​ in my hometown - absolute nightmare fuel) and while I realize that my children are statistically more likely to have a jet engine fall on them from the sky than get abducted by a stranger, I sometimes get a bit anxious letting my kids roam free.\n\nI've been resisting getting my eldest son a device, but I recently broke and bought him a ​Garmin Bounce​. I figured abating my anxiety and letting him roam free was better than the opposite.\n\nIt's a neat little device. It's basically a super dumbed down smart watch that has a no-configuration-required cellular connection.

writing this newsletter on a keyboard that costs more than a MacBook Pro and an iPad Pro combined.\n\nIt was meticulously built in California by an artisan workshop, ​Norbauer & Co.​, whose retrofuturist designs and meticulous attention to detail have created an almost mythical status in the keyboard community.\n\nI love the story of how it came to be on my desk, because this object (and our investment in the company behind it last year) encapsulates everything that I enjoy about being an investor, and what I think makes Tiny's approach to partnering with company founders special. Though modest in size compared to today’s announcement, Norbauer is one of my absolute favorites.\n\nI also like this story because it underscores the point that, in business, emotional and subjective

all began with a serendipitous encounter sixteen years ago.\n\nIn 2008, I spotted a guy getting off the L train in Chicago as I headed back to my hotel after a tech conference. We were both wearing the same SEED Conference badges around our necks. I glanced down and saw \"RYAN NORBAUER\", a name I recognized from a blog post I'd read on my then-favorite productivity blog, 43Folders. I stopped him and said hello.\n\nIt turned out that we both ran digital agencies, his specializing in development and mine in design. We were both skeptical of Silicon Valley hype, which is what had prompted us to attend SEED, a conference on bootstrapping creative businesses hosted by our mutual heroes, Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson and Jim Coudal.

2010, Ryan had sold one of his startups to OKCupid (Match.com) and was running two others, but he was losing his joy for entrepreneurship. His three businesses had caused him a profound amount of stress, and after years of struggling through the aspects of running a business that he didn't enjoy, he decided to sell everything, vowing to leave the business world forever.\n\nHe chose to dedicate his remaining decades to projects driven by curiosity and creativity rather than profit. A clean break from his former life.\n\nOf all things, he went deep into the world of mechanical keyboards.\n\nIf you're not familiar, there is a whole passionate subculture of keyboard enthusiasts, obsessed with tactile feedback, unique sound profiles, and meticulous craftsmanship.

started documenting his build process on online keyboard enthusiast forums, occasionally selling a few extras to help offset the production costs of making one for himself. His work quickly captured the imagination of the keyboard world, and the community kept nudging him to make more and more. He became something of a celebrity in this obscure community, with fans lining up at keyboard conventions to ask for autographs and selfies.\n\nAt some point he had stumbled into running yet another business, an accidental little keyboard empire.\n\nBecause this was a passion project, he went to extraordinary lengths in the pursuit of keyboard perfection—partnering with a Danish luxury

became the Enzo Ferrari of keyboards, not by following a business plan—truly, no sane person focused on the bottom line would have created these products—but by pursuing an extreme creative vision, competing for creations that would disappear from inventory within minutes.\n\nRyan's keyboards are engineering marvels, like mechanical watches in a digital age, but for his passionate clientele they are also deeply sentimental objects. There's absolutely no practical or purely rational reason for them to exist, but they embody the same passion that makes a Patek Philippe special: hundreds of custom precision components working in perfect harmony, assembled by hand, with every detail finessed down to the microscopic level.\n\nIn tech companies and finance firms across the world, Norbauers can be found sitting quietly on desks as one of those \"if you know, you know\" objects, connecting a community of people with a very nerdy but passionate form of taste that many people don't even know exists.

success brought its own problems. What began as a carefree hobby gradually transformed into a demanding operation.

Up to this point he had been focusing on making \"aftermarket upgrade\" components for keyboard enthusiasts to use in modifying existing platforms.

he wanted from us wasn't money. He needed a partner to handle the operational aspects that were increasingly consuming his attention so he could focus on what he was actually good at—designing and creating beautiful products. He needed someone to take the day-to-day off his hands so he could return to his workbench, focusing on matters of taste while knowing that the business was running efficiently, growing its technical capacities and creative options.\n\nHe thought of me, his old friend who has often written about having navigated this sort of problem successfully many times (albeit with copious speed bumps along the way) and reached out.\n\nA pattern exists across hundreds of the most successful companies.

creative founder needs someone who genuinely loves the operational work they find draining. Someone who gets excited about the things they hate.\n\nI've confronted this reality many times in my businesses. Over two decades, as each business has scaled, I've invariably found myself in a prison of my own making, buried in operational details that I hated.\n\nMore often than not, I've solved this quagmire in a counterintuitive way: by firing myself.\n\nLast year, after becoming completely overwhelmed with the operational details of overseeing some forty-odd companies, I fired myself as CEO of Tiny to refocus on what I do best: setting the vision, telling our story, and acquiring wonderful companies.\n\nMy business partner Chris and I found our own Tim Cook in Jordan Taub, a former Constellation Software executive who we'd steadily promoted through the ranks at Tiny over the years. Eventually, it became clear that Jordan was the ideal person to handle the day-to-day operations we'd always struggled with.","title":"🧠 Whether data is still a true moat in the LLM era","date":"March

making this change last June, Chris and I have felt completely revitalized, rediscovering our passion for the work we love and significantly increasing Tiny's dealflow and opportunity set by doing the things we're best at.\n\nThis is exactly what Ryan sought to do: fire himself from the agonizing details that distracted from his creative vision.\n\nThis is why I understood Ryan's dilemma so deeply. Throughout my career, I've seen how success can become its own kind of prison—especially when creators sell their businesses.\n\nI've experienced this first hand after selling some of my own companies. It felt like watching a beautiful garden I'd cultivated for years being methodically paved over for a parking lot. The DNA that made the company special vanished, replaced by all-or-nothing decisions that prioritized gains over long-term vitality.","title":"🧠 Whether data is still a true moat in the LLM

painful lessons shaped my philosophy when founding Tiny: create the acquisition partner I wish I could have sold to—one that preserves what makes a business special rather than imposing standardized \"best practices.\"\n\nWe've found three patterns in our acquisitions: founders who want to exit completely, those who just need us to buy out a troublesome partner, and those like Ryan who seek liberation—someone to handle what they hate while they refocus on what they love. This third case is surprisingly common. They don't want to abandon their creation; they want to fall back in love with it.\n\nMost private equity firms, with their McKinsey-trained MBAs and 5-year exit timelines, are fundamentally misaligned with this approach.

all this in mind, I realized that in order for our partnership with Ryan to work, I needed to find him his perfect executional partner. I paired him with my partner Caleb Bernabe—a perfect match for Ryan's sensibilities.\n\nWhen Caleb isn't running a highly profitable portfolio of businesses at Tiny, he co-owns a hip wine bar in Victoria and obsesses over vintage Leicas and Porsches. I knew that he would understand Ryan's pursuit of perfection—someone who could appreciate both the craftsmanship of the keyboards and translate his vision into a business that can slowly compound its profits and endure for decades.\n\nThe most important aspect of our deal wasn't financial.

encouraged him to pass off anything he didn't enjoy to Caleb and his team, giving Ryan space to develop the brand and product line.\n\nOne year into our partnership, and the results speak for themselves. Norbauer just launched the Seneca—its most ambitious keyboard ever—to exceptional praise, and they also recently added legendary keyboard tastemaker and content creator Taeha Kim to their team.\n\nThe ​Seneca​ stands as a masterpiece of engineering—682 custom parts built entirely by hand, with every component custom-made. Priced starting at $3,600, it's not for everyone, but for writers, coders, and thinkers who spend their days at a keyboard, it's the ultimate escape.\n\n‍“The Seneca is my middle finger to the aesthetic homogeneity and economic over-optimization of 21st century life.\n\nIts intricate mechanisms can only be assembled and tuned by human hands, over hours of skilled work—typically by a single

interesting byproduct of the Tiny partnership is that Norbauer is now a more profitable and sustainable business than before our involvement. What's even better is the whole thing is built on such a beautiful idea: make someone smile when they sit down at their desk.\n\nI love how randomness brought us together, the extraordinary product our partnership enabled (my fingers are tapping across my Seneca's keys as I write this), and how it redefines success by thriving through craftsmanship rather than scale—proving exceptional profitability doesn't require endless growth but instead, exceptional brand, deep relationships with a passionate base of clients, and a commitment to quality.\n\nHere's a ​link​ to check out all the insanely nerdy details of the keyboard. It’s quite the device.\n\nWe did work with Ryan to make a few build spots available around the timing of this announcement, but I can't promise there will be any available by the time you see this.

If you haven’t checked it out, I also highly recommend his bi-weekly podcast with Brad Gerstner, ​B2GPod​.\r\n‍\n\nChris and I are very flattered to be named the 2025 Entrepreneurs of The Year by the University of Victoria business school. They’re doing a big event for it, so if you’re in Victoria, we’d love to see you there on June 10th. ​Tickets here​.\r\n‍\r\nIf you live in Victoria, ​Cafe Malabar​, my favorite Indian restaurant, just opened a new location. It’s mind bogglingly good and you should go eat there.\r\n‍\r\nI have a very annoying problem: I primarily work from cafes, and many cafe owners do their best to foil people like me and have removed power plugs. I am happy to report that I’ve outsmarted them thanks to my ​Anker Power Bank​.\n\nIt’s basically a portable battery that I keep in my backpack and it gives me an extra 2 hours or so of battery life.\r\n‍\r\nAnother backpack upgrade: my friend Matt Mullenweg told me about these amazing ​Baseus Retractable USB-C cables​. My backpack used to be a rats nest of charging cables, but now I just have a few of these little circular USB pucks. When you’re done, you just give them a tug and they automatically retract.

1995, Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s longtime business partner, gave an incredible speech about why humans do stupid things.\n\nIn it, he breaks down all the key psychological effects that warp our thinking and cause bizarre behavior.\n\nIn 2014, I made it my mission to memorize this talk. I listened to it every single day on my drive to work and tattoo’d it into my brain.\n\nIt has been one of the most durable and important pieces of content I’ve ever consumed, and a few years ago, Chris and I decided to make it more accessible.\n\nWe took the original hour long scratchy audio recording and turned it into a shorter and more accessible animated video.\n\nI’d encourage you to listen to the ​full version​ (over, and over, and over again), but I wanted to share ​our animated version​ as a little primer.","title":"2.

wants to buy more businesses, and we need your help to find them.\n\nWe’ve found that the best opportunities often come from simply asking around.\n\nSo here I am, requesting your help.

Let me know if you think of anyone we should talk to.\r\n‍\n\nA few weeks ago, I went on My First Million, my favorite podcast, and talked about how I, for one, welcome our new AI overlords.

Hill House. Reformation. The Honest Company.\n\n‍In 2009, she was a broke designer. Today, her company, ​Pact​ is the secret sauce behind-the-scenes on some of the biggest success stories in retail. Like ​Metalab​, but for ecommerce companies.\n\nUsually, someone with such absurdly good taste comes at a cost. You hire the designer who makes the world’s most beautiful website and brand but… it doesn’t convert.

explained, \"If your brain were a computer, working memory would be its RAM. It temporarily holds and processes information, like remembering a phone number long enough to dial it or doing mental math. Yours is way below average—imagine trying to juggle while holding only two balls when most people can handle four.\"\n\n\"On the other hand,\" she went on, \"your crystallized intelligence is like your mental library—everything you've learned, the skills, facts, and experiences you've accumulated. That part of your brain is above average.\"\n\n‍Her assessment rang true. I could barely remember a simple grocery list without spacing.\n\n‍\"You might want to get tested for ADHD,\" she suggested. \"Poor working memory is often indicative of some form of ADHD.\"\n\nI left the appointment feeling unsettled. Something about it didn't sit right—there was no way I had ADHD.

noticed the endless stream of TikTok videos and social media posts about adult ADHD diagnoses and rolled my eyes. It had become the explanation for everything—another mental health meme where everyone thought they had the disorder.\n\nI'd always been proud of my ability to power through work, tick off to-do lists, and juggle multiple projects. If anything, I saw myself as productive and organized—traits that seemed at odds with having ADHD. I had dismissed it as overhyped. A diagnosis given out too freely, especially in regards to the growing number of kids being prescribed amphetamine drugs.\n\n‍While I was skeptical, I spent the next afternoon deep-diving into ADHD.\n\n‍As I read, my skepticism began to evaporate and I started to feel like an asshole...\n\nThe first thing that struck me was how quantifiable it was. I learned that scientists can literally see a difference in the brains of people with ADHD on MRI scans and that ADHD brains even grow more slowly.

couldn't deny it anymore—ADHD was as real as any other medical condition. I was reminded of how my parents' generation had scoffed at the idea of \"anxiety\" and \"depression\" and their fears that everyone was popping Prozac to avoid dealing with the reality of life. Was this just the modern equivalent? Was I, just like 90’s boomers, a mental health bigot?\n\nAs I dug deeper, I discovered that ADHD isn't just visible in brain structure—it's fundamentally written into our genetics. According to a study in Nature Genetics, ADHD is up to 88% heritable (even more than height!), making it one of the most inherited psychiatric conditions out there. If you have it, there's a near certainty that one of your parents does too.\n\nReading this, my thoughts turned to my father: his constant forgetfulness, his impulsive purchases, his encyclopedic knowledge of random topics paired with an uncanny ability to tune out or forget whatever everyone else deemed important.

years, I'd treated what I thought was just anxiety with an SSRI (vortioxetine), and while it helped a ton, that frantic, life-on-fire feeling of being overwhelmed had never really gone away. Studies show why: up to 50% of adults with ADHD also have anxiety disorders, suggesting what I thought was just anxiety might have been masking a deeper neurological difference.\n\nI was shocked to learn that ADHD's downsides extended far beyond distraction. Untreated, it has profound effects on those who have it, to the point where it can shorten their lives by almost a decade.\n\n‍A 2015 Lancet study found that people with untreated ADHD die, on average, 9.5 years earlier than their peers.

shows adults with ADHD are also five times more likely to develop substance use disorders, with up to 25% struggling with drug or alcohol addiction. Suddenly, my five nights per week of partying and binge drinking throughout my twenties made a lot more sense—the only way I could relax during the stressful ramp-up of my businesses. Self-medication.\n\nI also thought of the rampant drug and alcohol abuse in my extended family. Sure, this wasn’t a blanket explanation, but if what I was reading was true, there were likely a few family members who had untreated ADHD and had instead turned to drugs and alcohol, destroying their

Swedish study of over 38,000 individuals with ADHD found that stimulant medication reduced substance abuse rates by 31% compared to those not taking medication. The protective effect was even stronger in younger patients, with those 15 and under showing a 62% lower rate of substance abuse.\n\nFortunately, many patients who start taking stimulants as children respond so well they eventually stop needing medication by adulthood—the medication potentially rewiring their brains.\n\nMy concerns about treating children disappeared. This now seemed like a critical intervention.\n\n‍But here's where the story takes an unexpected turn. It’s not all bad news—in fact, in many ways, ADHD can be a gift.\n\n‍While ADHD can be challenging in traditional settings, these same traits can become surprising advantages in the right context.

includes some of the most successful business leaders: Richard Branson has been open about his ADHD diagnosis, crediting it for his creative thinking and risk-taking ability. JetBlue founder David Neeleman has described how ADHD helped him see opportunities others missed, while IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad used his ADHD traits to build one of the world's largest furniture companies.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense. The very traits that make traditional jobs challenging become superpowers in entrepreneurship: a tendency to see the big picture while delegating details, the ability to hyperfocus intensely on whatever interests us, a knack for building systems to compensate for our weaknesses.\n\nEven our social tendencies—the constant need to connect, share, and build relationships—create powerful networks that drive business success. The entrepreneurial world, with its constant change and need for adaptability, seems almost perfectly designed for minds that thrive on novelty and creative problem-solving.","title":"\"But your

may represent an evolutionary advantage that's mismatched with modern life. Some researchers propose these traits helped our ancestors excel at hunting—where heightened awareness of movement, quick reactions, and constant environmental scanning were crucial survival skills.\n\n‍\"The hunter is easily distracted by movement and sound—traits that make them exceptional at tracking prey but challenging in today's structured environments.\"\n\n‍This perspective helps explain why ADHD traits correlate with entrepreneurial success. Both hunting and building businesses reward adaptability, quick pattern recognition, and comfort with uncertainty.\n\nIt's as if the business world had accidentally created the perfect environment for minds that don't fit the conventional mold.

I read all this, it was like watching dominoes fall in slow motion—each symptom clicking into place, each pattern revealing itself with almost painful clarity.\n\nI realized the intricate web of systems I'd built wasn't just about being organized—it was a coping mechanism. I'd become obsessed with David Allen's Getting Things Done productivity system, spending hours maintaining its complex organization system.\n\nMy phone was filled with thousands of Siri reminders shouted while driving, desperately trying to capture the stream of urgent thoughts racing through my brain before they vanished like smoke.\n\n‍I needed these systems because without them, important tasks would slip through the cracks of my unreliable working memory.\n\n‍Every notification, every color-coded calendar entry, every obsessively maintained checklist was compensation for what my brain

about how ADHD plays out in romantic relationships and family life, I recognized myself.\n\nSomeone who would drift off during intimate conversations with my partner, yet could spend hours intensely focused on unrelated projects. Forgetting commitments and neglecting agreed upon chores.\n\nI felt that I was a loving and supportive partner in many ways, but these seemingly basic aspects of home life felt inexplicably challenging.\n\n‍These challenges weren't limited to relationships.\n\n‍My work life prior to starting my company was equally difficult. I couldn't stick to the same routine tasks day in and day out and frequently jumped from job to job, impulsively quitting and moving on, sometimes without notice because I couldn't bear the idea of showing up to work another day.\n\nSo in 2006, driven more by desperation than inspiration, I started my first business. Over the next five years, I impulsively launched ten separate companies, attempting to be the CEO of all of them at once.","title":"\"But your crystallized intelligence,\" she continued, \"is

you can imagine, this failed spectacularly. It wasn't until 2014 that I finally found my groove: buying great companies and hiring wonderful CEOs (who don't have ADHD) to run them.\n\n‍My inability to handle details didn't leave me any choice but to embrace delegation.\n\n‍While many entrepreneurs struggled to let go of tasks, I had the luxury of being absolutely terrible at them from the start.\n\nMy habit of getting obsessed with random parts of the business meant I'd go super deep on M&A for a few weeks, suddenly get bored, then jump to product, then marketing—basically whatever shiny object caught my attention that week.\n\nThis scattered approach somehow worked in my favor—being an inch deep and a mile wide on every part of the business turned out to be exactly what a CEO needed to be.\n\nThen there was my insatiable need to meet new people and socialize—often the most immediately rewarding part of my day, a reliable hit of dopamine. I'd strike up conversations with anyone, everywhere.","title":"\"But your crystallized intelligence,\" she continued, \"is solid.\"","date":"March 12,

so much networking as a complete failure to hold my cards close to my chest. This chronic oversharing somehow worked in my favor. When problems came up, I usually knew someone who could help.\n\nWithin a matter of weeks, I had booked a formal diagnosis, and a month later, my neurologist's suspicions were confirmed: I had inattentive ADHD. They recommended a stimulant, and one day I buckled up and took Vyvanse.\n\n‍The most surprising thing was the quiet. My brain previously felt like Times Square at New Year's, hundreds of thoughts competing for attention at once. On Vyvanse, it was more like a library. One thought at a time, each one getting its proper attention before moving to the next.\n\nImagine living your whole life with a radio playing static in your head, and then someone finally shows you where the 'off' switch is. That feeling of being overwhelmed by midday, like hitting an invisible cognitive wall—vanished.

sharing all this because for years, I felt kind of broken.\n\n‍Like I was constantly letting everyone down. Sure, I'd found ways to cope—building a business where I could delegate all the things I was terrible at, engineering a scaffolding of to-do lists and reminders, and surrounding myself with amazing people who could handle what I couldn't.\n\nBut that strategy falls apart in your personal life. You can't delegate being a dad, or a partner, or a friend. Those relationships require consistency, attention to detail, being present—exactly the things ADHD makes so challenging.\n\nThe impact on family life has also been notable. Before, by dinner time, my mental energy would be completely depleted.

I can follow a bedtime story without my mind wandering off to work emails, or sit through a family dinner without yawning or zoning out. The day I first took medication, all I kept thinking was that I wish I'd been taking this my whole life, or at the very least, before my kids were born.\n\n‍All this is to say, getting diagnosed has been transformative for me.\n\n‍Like discovering the long-lost manual to my brain and realizing I've been using it wrong this whole time. I wanted to share in hopes that someone like me—who's struggling but has never thought about ADHD—might read this, see themselves in it, and seek treatment themselves.\n\nIf you're reading this and any of it sounds familiar, I'd recommend checking out The ADHD Effect on Marriage by Melissa Orlov and Dr. Russell Barkley's excellent book, Taking Charge of Adult ADHD.

if you're listening to some of this and nodding along, thinking you might have it too, you could try prompting ChatGPT with this prompt to suss it out:\n\n‍Act as a clinician conducting a pre-assessment for ADHD. Ask me structured, clinically relevant questions to explore my symptoms, history, and their impact on my life. Cover: core symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity), their effect on daily life (work, relationships, self-care), medical and family history, lifestyle factors (sleep, diet, stress), coping strategies, and how long symptoms have persisted. Summarize my responses into a professional document I can share with a clinician.\n\n‍You should also watch the excellent YouTube video on diagnosis by Russel Barkley, which I link in the thread

are tons of telehealth pill-mills that ask you ten questions then rubber stamp you a lifetime prescription of stimulants—you should avoid those. I think it's worth doing a full assessment, which is a multi-hour process that includes qualitative and quantitative testing.\n\nI got diagnosed at ​Resilient Health​ in Victoria and was impressed by how thorough they were. The assessment wasn't some quick DSM checklist. It was a comprehensive process involving interviews with me, as well as Zoe and my family, coupled with extensive attention and memory tests. It took about six hours altogether, and at the end I had a detailed document explaining both my ADHD diagnosis and my overall psychological profile.\n\nAnd if you're curious about brain health in general—something almost nobody seems to assess outside of my extreme health nerd friends—the neurologist who identified this for me was ​Dr. Kellyann Niotis​.

think we need to get ripped. But honestly, wearing a well-layered and color coordinated outfit and nice shoes is 90% of the battle.\n\nI loved having a personal stylist, but found it kind of annoying having to depend on someone else to not look like a schmoe.\n\n‍Every day, I'd upload a photo of whatever pants I was wearing and say \"complete this outfit\".\n\nI was amazed by how good it was. And it got better over time, as I trained a custom GPT on my wardrobe.\n\nSuddenly I didn't need my personal stylist—I had an AI one.\n\nBut my ChatGPT based system was kind of fiddly. It required prompting and uploading lots of photos and messing with instructions to produce something good.\n\nSo, I saw an opportunity. I called up my friend Hamza and told him I wanted to turn this into a thin wrapper app.\n\nThat was about 4 months ago, and now we have a beta that uses OpenAI and a few other APIs to achieve the same thing in a beautiful app.","title":"And I started getting compliments daily!

down to give someone 50%+ of the equity and pass the baton.\n\nI’m looking for a private covered or indoor pickleball court in Victoria, BC that I can rent/borrow/beg for during the winters. Does anyone have any leads? The only one I’m aware of is a 40 min drive away so I’m looking for something more central.\r\n‍\r\n‘Song In My Head’ by Madison Cunningham is stuck on repeat in my brain. ​Very good​.\r\n‍\r\nI have a lot of small interior design projects that are small enough to not necessitate my favorite interior design firm (​Studio Roslyn​) but still require someone with great taste. For example: choosing a nice light fixture in a random secondary bathroom / Doing a simple kitchen reno in one of my rental properties.\n\nI’m looking for a young, scrappy (read: affordable) person with incredible taste and experience with projects like this. I’m willing to take a bit of a chance on someone, but you can’t be a complete amateur and you have to demonstrate that you have great taste and have done a few projects somehow. If you know someone like this, email me :-)\r\n‍\r\nI'll be visiting Pheonix/Scottsdale for a few days in the next couple weeks and I'd love to meet interesting people.

you’re getting this: this is my Friends Newsletter, a brain dump of interesting things that I send to interesting people I've met and friends I want to stay in touch with. Zero pressure to stick around—just click unsubscribe if you don’t want to get it (don’t worry, I won’t be notified).\n\nFor years, my inbox has been my prison. A treadmill of pseudo-productivity that eats my every waking minute. Always desperate to get to the elusive “inbox zero,” but never quite succeeding.\n\nI’ve tried every app. Every filtering strategy. I even built ​custom software​ so that I’d only get email in batches a few times a day.\n\n‍Nothing worked. Like an addict, my thoughts would always drift back to that horrible fucking number.\n\nThe unread badge. All the opportunities I was missing. People I was letting down.

six months ago, I did the only thing an addict can do: I quit.\n\nI deleted all the email apps on my phone, then used Screen Time and ​Freedom​ to make email completely inaccessible by app or browser and had my girlfriend set the password.\n\nI gave my assistant an extensive list of how to triage the inbox (what to send where). Then I asked her to create a Google Doc for each day’s important emails and copy/paste any messages she felt needed a response into the doc once a day.\n\nIt was simple and extremely manual—and oddly enough, it worked.\n\nToday, every 3-5 days, I go into the folder with all the email Google Docs and skim through them. I scratch out some responses, and then I forget about email for another few days.\n\nIt has freed up my time more than any other “life hack”.\n\nI no longer suffer under the shackles of my inbox.

problems are the same. The volume is the same. I’m just not aware of it as often.\n\nAnd what happened? Nothing. No negative feedback from anyone, just more time to work and less stress on my plate hour-to-hour.\n\nA bit like only reading the news once a week(something I have also implemented that has immeasurably improved my life).\n\nBy the way, if you want to implement this for yourself, you should hire an assistant from ​Athena​. My assistant, Tina, is incredible. She’s based in the Philippines and we pay ⅓ of what we’d pay in North America for far better attention and service.\r\n‍\n\nQuick update on ​PressurePros​, the pressure washing business I launched here in Victoria with a random college kid I met.\n\n‍So far, we’ve completed thousands of dollars of work and have quoted over $10,000 in jobs.

role has mainly been behind the scenes, focusing on finances (like buying all the equipment), marketing (Google Ads, promotions, demand generation), and tech. I’ve been blown away by how good small business software has become.\n\nWe’re running almost everything through ​Jobber​—from tracking leads to quoting, invoicing, billing, scheduling, and even dispatching the team. It’s incredible software, and I’m seriously impressed with how seamless it makes operations.\n\nBetween AI (which I used to write, build and generate photos for the website and ad copy) and all the great modern software and payments infrastructure, being a small business entrepreneur in 2025 is pretty awesome.\r\n‍\n\nWhen people are impressed that I'm the guy who started Metalab, I chuckle. Why? Because behind the scenes it was complete and utter chaos.

​Metalab​ is the world’s top product design firm working with Fortune 500 companies. But back then, almost twenty years ago—man, I feel old—we were clueless nobodies working out of a tiny hovel of an apartment.\n\nMy pal (and employee #2 at Metalab), Mark Nichols, just posted a ​nostalgic tweet thread​ about what it was like, complete with embarrassing pictures from our first office.\n\nIt’s a wild flashback and a good reminder that big things start small. It was also, ironically, when business was the absolute most fun (though, like most youths, we didn’t appreciate that at the moment).","title":"January 22, 2025","date":"January 22,

of which, if you’re running a dainty little agency like we were back in the day and you need a shoulder to cry on, Mark recently hung up his spurs and started coaching agency owners. ​You guys should talk​.\r\n‍\n\nIf a scientist scraped my children’s teeth, they would probably discover new antibiotics. Let’s be real: kids barely brush their teeth. Mine certainly don’t.\n\nSure, the toothbrush goes in their mouths, but they’re chatting, dancing, and usually lucky if it grazes a tooth or two.\n\nI recently got my boys ​Autobrush​ toothbrushes. They are basically bristled U-shaped electric toothbrushes that clean their entire mouth in 30 seconds. They also flash bright lights and play a little song which the boys are big fans of.\n\nIn clinical studies, the Autobrush proved to be 27 times more effective at removing plaque than manual toothbrushes. While traditional brushing only reduced plaque by 1.9%, the Autobrush achieved a 50.6% reduction across the entire mouth.","title":"‍“I wish I didn’t know now what I didn’t know then” —Bob

been learning about a man that Charlie Munger called the greatest business operator of all time.\n\n‍​James J. Hill​ built the Great Northern Railway in the late 1800s without federal land grants (unlike his competitors) and created one of the only transcontinental railroads that never went bankrupt (also unlike his competitors, who almost all went bankrupt). He was obsessively focused on the details—personally testing different grades of coal to cut fuel costs and even redesigning locomotive wheels to handle steep mountain grades more efficiently. Think Elon Musk of the 19th century, but with less drama.\n\nMy friend David Senra (host of my all-time favorite podcast, ​Founders​) introduced me to this awesome 4-part documentary about Hill and his impact on the Pacific Northwest.

don’t know why, but I absolutely hate calling restaurants to book reservations. Sure, lots of places are on OpenTable, but many popular restaurants still require phone calls.\n\nOf all the AI tools I've been experimenting with, ​Lindy​ has blown me away with its ability to create agents that can handle traditionally human tasks.\n\nFor example, I just fixed this problem for myself by making an AI agent that calls restaurants to make reservations for me.\n\n‍1. I text it the name of the restaurant, desired time and number of guests.\n\n2. It calls the restaurant (in an incredibly real sounding voice) and makes the reservation.\n\n3. If they don't have the time available, it texts me some alternate times (and can call back to make them). If they do, it books it.\n\n4.

you’re getting this: this is my Friends Newsletter, a monthly brain dump of interesting things that I send to interesting people I've met and friends I want to stay in touch with.

told him he should start another business. That getting an MBA is fine, but nothing beats experience.\n\nAfter some brainstorming, we decided to launch a pressure washing business together. We quickly threw together a website and brand and started buying equipment.\n\nIt’s called ​PressurePros​ and we’re now live in Victoria. We’ve done our first few jobs and the feedback has been great.\n\nIf you’re based here and need your property (residential or commercial) pressure washed, ​email Andan​ and tell him I sent you. 💪\r\n‍\n\nThis weekend, I found myself gritting my teeth. It was like there was an itch I couldn't quite scratch in my brain. Work felt unsatisfying. My family's usual quirks grated on my nerves. Everything just felt off.\n\nThen I glanced at my Apple Watch, and the answer became clear. Two complications, little dials on either side of my screen, told the whole story: my training load had plunged to the bottom, and my sleep quality was in the red.

worn an Apple Watch for years and mostly been underwhelmed. Despite collecting nearly a decade of health data, I'd gained few meaningful insights. It had become little more than an expensive calendar and weather widget strapped to my wrist.\n\nBut the latest WatchOS update has finally made my data useful with its Vitals features. It's elegantly simple: track your sleep patterns and workout intensity, then display clear visual gauges when you're falling below your baselines.\n\nNow when I see them dipping, it's a nudge: time to grab my tennis racket or get to bed earlier. A simple, but insanely useful little feature that I love.\n\n(And one that also may put devices like the Whoop and Oura Ring out of business.)\n\nI hate banking in Canada.

bank is a bloated hedge maze of bureaucracy. And don’t even get me started on their apps and websites or their approach to tech companies…\n\nI remember, a few years ago, a major Canadian bank wanted us to put down a $25,000 deposit in order to get a corporate credit card simply because we were a tech company. (At a time when we did over $50 million dollars in revenue and were highly profitable!)\n\nIt's gotten better since then. The Canadian banks have woken up and now lend to tech companies, but I’m always jealous of all the incredible tools my American friends get. Ramp. Mercury. Rippling.\n\nThese tools are finally rolling out in Canada, and my current favorite is a Toronto-based startup called ​Vault​.

spend getting out of hand? Just cancel your team’s credit cards quarterly and spin up new ones—people will not sign back up for the stuff they aren’t using (this strategy has already saved us tens of thousands of dollars).\n\n- You can set spend and transaction type limits (for example, you could make a card for your assistant with a $500 limit that only works at gas stations)\n\n- And even manage all your outgoing wires and accounts payable/receivables right from Vault\n\nI’m a huge fan. It’s so nice to see fintech innovation like this finally coming to Canada.\n\n‍As they always seem to, Lululemon has taken something we’re all used to and subtly improved upon. In my mind, they are the Dyson of clothing (perfecting simple, everyday things, with engineering and design).\n\nFor example: I’ve always hated men’s bathing suits. The liner rides up. They’re always slightly too short. They puff up whenever you get into a hot tub then release a massive air bubble, which looks like you’ve just released a fart. A few years ago, Lululemon released the ​perfect men’s bathing suit​.

now they’ve done the same thing for men’s shoes. I recently got a pair of the ​Men’s Cityverse Sneakers​ and within weeks they became my default shoe. They look sharp, feel like walking on a pillow, and are rugged and well built. I’m a fan.\r\n‍\n\nDr. Andrew Huberman has instilled the fear of god in me. Every evening, I dim every light in our house, scuttling around like a poor man’s Dracula, avoiding blue light.\n\nAfter all, as Huberman has ​so loudly proclaimed​, blue light after sunset destroys your sleep. It makes it harder to go to bed, affects your sleep quality, and alters your circadian rhythm.\n\nI think we all know this intuitively. I’ve always found that on camping trips or when the power goes out, I often fall asleep earlier and feel more relaxed. But I’ve really embraced dimming all the lights in our house in the evening over the last few years and found it helps my sleep a ton.","title":"‍Have I eaten well?\r\nHave I slept enough?\r\nHave I

one type of light that doesn’t affect your sleep, however, is red light, and I recently found these ​great little Helight red light pucks​.\n\nAs for those moments where I need to watch a movie with my girlfriend, I don these insanely fashionable ​blue light blocking glasses​.\n\nSo, if you want to embrace your inner Dracula and sleep like the dead, go grab a few red light pucks, slap on a pair of blue light blocking glasses, and let yourself drift off.\n\nI think you’ll be surprised by how much of a difference it makes. (And just how embarrassed your partner will be, even though nobody else is around.)\r\n‍\n\nI’m a terrible dresser. For years, I dressed like a dope, but last year I started using ChatGPT as my personal stylist.

Take photos of your wardrobe\r\n2. It creates outfits for you and renders beautiful images of what they look like\n\nWe’re looking for beta testers. Email ​tina@tiny.com​ with the subject “Fashion Beta Test” and we’ll add you to the Testflight :-)\r\n‍\n\n‍I need to hire someone based in Victoria to help me with random IT/tech problems (configuring smart devices, wireless networking — all the little tasks I don’t have time for). Previously a UVIC student helped me with this stuff, but he’s off to grad school and I’ve lost him.\n\nAny leads? This would be the perfect job for me 20 years ago.

was a day, many years ago, when your parents put you down and never picked you back up.\n\n‍The same is true of many wonderful things in life. Tim Urban put it poignantly in his 2015 piece ​The Tail End​: \"It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I'm now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We're in the tail end.\"\n\n‍This doesn't just apply to parents. Many life experiences follow a similar pattern.\n\nAs we age, we meet fewer new friends. We stop seeing live music. We travel in less adventurous ways. For most people, unfortunately, our worlds gradually contract.\n\nThe realization that struck me recently was that it had been years since I had danced.\n\nIn my twenties, two or three nights a week, I would get drunk and dance at nightclubs for hours on end.

I quit drinking. Had kids. Started going to bed at 9 PM.\n\nSuddenly, dancing was...just gone from my life. It felt like a small part of me had died—as silly as that might sound.\n\nA few weeks ago, I discovered a local group that meets every Sunday to dance. It's sober. At 11 AM every Sunday in a big events space, a DJ does a 90-minute set and 70-100 people dance their heads off. Old and young, some with dreads and flowing robes, others wearing polo shirts and slacks. No rhyme or reason. Just people who love to dance, letting loose.\n\nIt's called ​Dance Temple​. It started in Vancouver, and now there are groups all over the place.\n\nIt sure beats being hungover. If you miss dancing, I highly recommend seeing if something like this exists in your city.\r\n‍\n\n‍I’ve been deep in the AI tools rabbit hole.

Spotify / YouTube / Apple Podcasts​\r\n​\n\nHow to be a great parent by ignoring your kids.\r\n​\r\n​I found myself scratching my head while listening to a recent episode of The Daily, all about the misery of modern parenting.\r\n​\r\nWhen did raising children become so exhausting? According to the podcast, 71% of parents report that parenting is more stressful than ever before. So much so that even the U.S. Surgeon General has declared parenting a significant health risk.\r\n​\r\n​Let’s take a minute to let that set in.\r\n​\r\n​A role that is foundational to humanity’s very existence—alongside eating and sleeping—is now so burdened with stress that it’s become a mental health crisis.\r\n​\r\nIn fact, modern parenting makes us so miserable that an increasing number of people are deciding not to have children at all.\r\n​\r\nI’ve seen this firsthand: when I speak to people under 30, many of them are opting out of parenthood entirely.\r\n​\r\nSometimes it’s due to concerns about climate change, but more often, it’s because they’ve seen others struggle with parenthood and decided it doesn’t seem appealing.\r\n​\r\n​Fair enough. Modern parenting is a sad existence for many.\r\n​\r\n​We modern parents have calendars that look like a game of Tetris. 4:00 PM soccer practice, 5:30 PM piano lessons, 6:45 PM math tutoring, weekend slots filled with never-ending dance recitals and birthday parties. We transition from an autonomous child-free existence to a tiny human’s full-time taxi driver, personal assistant, therapist, and security detail.\r\n​\r\nWe live in constant fear of traumatizing our kids, as if the slightest lapse in parental calm could spiral into a lifetime of intravenous drug use.\r\n​\r\nWe’re consumed with guilt for using daycare, hiring help, or even taking time for ourselves, as if involving others in caregiving somehow diminishes our role or negatively impacts our children’s development.\r\n​\r\nAnd we hover at playgrounds, ensuring our delicate children are saved from any unnecessary bumps or scrapes.\r\n​\r\nOpportunities for work, hobbies, or simply having adult conversations are put aside—all sacrificed at the altar of ‘perfect’ parenting.\r\n​\r\n​No wonder parents are so unhappy.\r\n​\r\n​And why?\r\n​\r\n​Because it’s completely unnatural.​\r\n​\r\n​Humans are happiest when they live in alignment with their instincts.\r\n​\r\nThink about what makes us feel great - the experiences that light up our brains with feel-good chemicals like serotonin and oxytocin:\r\n​\r\n- Deep friendships forged through shared experiences\r\n​\r\n- Intimate connections and romance\r\n​\r\n- The pleasure of a meal shared with loved ones\r\n​\r\n- The rush of physical movement and play\r\n​\r\n- The belonging that comes from being part of a community\r\n​\r\n- The grounding effect of time spent in nature\r\n​\r\nIt's no coincidence that these are the things our brains are designed for, and continue to make us happy. We're running the same \"hardware\" (our brains) as our hunter gatherer ancestors, so it's no surprise that we enjoy the same things that they would have done.\r\n​\r\nIt just feels right to lift heavy objects, wander around in nature, eat tasty food, and laugh with friends—the very things that are being sacrificed in modern parenting.\r\n​\r\n​What’s wild is that this is an altogether new phenomenon. Just a few decades ago, children roamed their neighborhoods unaccompanied until dinner.\r\n​\r\n​Parents were preoccupied with work, social activities, and sports. The idea was that kids could entertain themselves.\r\n​\r\nMy generation was one of the last to experience this: In the early 90s, by the time I was around eight years old, I was completely free range. No cell phone. No parents watching. Just me and my buddies riding around in a pack on our bikes throwing rocks at stuff. I’m grateful I got to experience this—but I worry that unless I fight for it, my own children won’t have this same level of freedom, autonomy, and the confidence that comes with it.\r\n​\r\nBased on what we know about hunter gatherer societies, caregiving was communal, with adults sharing the responsibility for watching over children, a system known as “alloparenting”. Studies of groups like the !Kung San and Hadza show that older children often cared for younger ones, allowing parents more time for work and leisure. This communal approach promoted social learning and independence among children, while reducing the parenting burden on any one adult. Kids ran around in a pack, with the older kids taking care of the younger ones, while the parents hung out, went hunting, and all that other Hunter Gatherer-y stuff.\r\n​\r\nThere was no hovering or formalized instruction. Adults did their own thing and left the kids to their own devices unless safety concerns arose, allowing them to learn from their own mistakes and build independence. Children fit into their parents’ lives, not the other way around.\r\n​\r\n​This communal, more relaxed approach worked for hundreds of thousands of years. But over the last few decades, something shifted.\r\n​\r\n​Here’s a Before/After comparison:\r\n​\r\n​- Communal Parenting ➞ Two parents trapped in a lonely house with little kids\r\n​\r\n- Natural, Outdoor Play ➞ Structured indoor play with technology and educational toys\r\n​\r\n- Free-Range Exploration ➞ Supervised, scheduled playdates and activities\r\n​\r\n- Shared Childcare ➞ Childcare limited to parents and grandparents\r\n​\r\n- Intergenerational Interaction ➞ Nuclear family units with minimal extended family interaction\r\n​\r\n- Inherent Physical Activity ➞ Sedentary lifestyles with scheduled exercise\r\n​\r\n- Attachment to a Broad Group of Caregivers ➞ Focus on primary attachment to one or two parents\r\n​\r\n​So what changed?\r\n​\r\n​In the late 20th century, a shift occurred in the psyche of North American parents—a shift not rooted in science or logic, but in something far more insidious: fear.\r\n​\r\nThe 1980s marked a turning point. The faces of missing children began appearing on milk cartons. Shows like America's Most Wanted turned rare tragedies into prime-time entertainment. Cable news discovered that stories of child abduction drove ratings, creating what sociologists now call \"mean world syndrome\" - the belief that the world is far more dangerous than statistics show. A generation of parents internalized these fears, despite living in what may be the safest time in human history to raise children.\r\n​\r\n​Consider this truly insane fact:\r\n​\r\n​The statistical likelihood of your child being abducted by a stranger is about 1 in 1.5 million, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.\r\n​\r\n​To put that in perspective, your child is twice as likely to be struck by lightning, an event that hardly dictates our daily choices. Yet, the disproportionate fear of abduction has led parents to cocoon their children in layers of protection that earlier generations would find unrecognizable.\r\n​\r\nIronically, studies have shown that this overprotective ‘helicopter’ parenting hinders a child’s ability to navigate the world independently, leading to heightened anxiety and diminished problem-solving skills. A study published in the Journal of Child and Family Studies found that children granted less autonomy experienced higher stress levels and lower overall life satisfaction.\r\n​\r\nSo, in our quest to shield our children from improbable dangers, we’re inadvertently exposing them to the very real risks of anxiety, dependency, and a diminished sense of self.\r\n​\r\n​How do we fix this in our own families?\r\n​\r\n​Imagine if I told you that the secret to losing weight was to eat more ice cream.\r\n​\r\nWell, this is one of those magical situations where the solution is actually to take the easy road.\r\n​\r\nIt’s simple: give yourself a break. Stop over-scheduling, stop trying to constantly entertain and enrich your kids, and instead embrace what has worked for tens of thousands of years.\r\n​\r\n​Here’s what I’ve been doing in our household:\r\n​\r\n​- I’ve stopped entertaining the boys—I let them get bored and engage in creative play, ideally in the backyard. If they want to join in what I’m doing or help, that’s great. Of course, I’ll step in if someone is badly injured, and we still have lots of nice family rituals (reading time, family dinner, sports, etc.), but most of the time, it’s their job to entertain themselves.\r\n​\r\nI’m always amazed by how, after a few minutes of whining, they disappear into a corner of the house, immersed in their own little world for hours.\r\n​\r\n- I’m resisting scheduling their time (one sport each—that’s it).\r\n​\r\n- I’m inviting large groups of their friends over to recreate “packs” of kids. (I find I don’t hear from them for hours when we do this—they completely occupy themselves.)\r\n​\r\n- I limit screens. (I do let them use iPads, but they’re strictly screen-timed, and once the timer is up, that’s it.)\r\n​\r\n- I bring them along with me to run errands. (They always complain at first, but end up having fun.)\r\n​\r\n- I try to focus on activities we both enjoy (versus standing around at some kid activity I hate.).\r\n​\r\n- I coordinate with other parents to pawn my children off for playdates at their house, or vice versa, and get together with other families to share meals as often as I can. (It’s amazing how much easier it is parenting as a group.)\r\n​\r\n- Soon, I’m going to start letting them bike to the park or play dates on their own. (I’m also working on getting more parents to agree to collectively send their kids to parks at the same time, so they aren’t doing this alone.\r\n​\r\nThe evidence is clear: humans have successfully raised resilient, capable children for over 300,000 years without this anxiety-riddled misery. The solution to modern parenting isn't to parent harder - it's to parent lazier.\r\n​\r\n​If we don’t, the next generation will have two options:​\r\n​\r\n1. Live a semi-miserable, stress-filled existence for 18-years (have kids).\r\n​\r\n2. Never discover the wonders of raising a child, one of the great joys of life (no kids).\r\n​\r\nThat’s a depressing thought, and potentially a real threat to humanity’s future.\r\n​\r\nSo do your part.

says…\r\n​\r\n​A few years ago, Tiny teamed up with Dr. Andrew Huberman to acquire Mateina, a Montreal-based company specializing in premium yerba mate.\r\n​\r\nMateina’s loose-leaf and canned yerba mate have become a daily ritual for me, thanks to yerba mate’s health benefits and mellow caffeine high. (I find it much less anxiety-inducing than coffee, despite having over 120 mg of caffeine.)\r\n​\r\nNow, they’ve made it even easier to enjoy yerba mate anytime, anywhere, with their latest innovation: yerba mate + electrolyte sticks.\r\n​\r\nSimply tear open a stick, stir it into hot or cold water, and you’ll have a refreshing drink packed with naturally occurring caffeine.

hate wealth managers.\r\n​\r\n​Most of them add zero value and charge you a fortune to do something you could do yourself for free (build a diversified ETF portfolio).\r\n​\r\nAnd yet there’s so many of them.\r\n​\r\nIt’s not logical, but people like having “a guy” they trust. A trustworthy man or woman they met at the golf club who looks good in a suit and gives them a firm handshake.\r\n​\r\nWhy? Because investing is kind of scary for most people.\r\n​\r\nYou can explain ETFs and Peter Lynch (“buy what you know”) and all that stuff, but ultimately, most people prefer having “a guy”.\r\n​\r\nWhat sucks is, that person—usually a generically handsome tall man with salt and pepper hair and a name like Chase, Brock, or Preston—often doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about.\r\n​\r\nI can’t tell you how many times I've had these wealth management dudes pitch me, then watched them melt like a popsicle in death valley when I ask them the most basic investing questions.\r\n​\r\nUnfortunately, most of them are just sales people who sell you something you could easily buy yourself.\r\n​\r\nBut I digress. Look—some of you are just going to want “a guy.”\r\n​\r\nSo, I’d like to refer you to someone who I love.\r\n​\r\nMy friend Jon Ronkai runs an accounting firm, and for almost 20 years he’s been investing his own money. He’s a dyed-in-the-wool value investor, and we actually met because we’re both part of a group of investors that meets monthly to talk about stocks. Over the years, I’ve often nodded my head as he talked about an investment idea, and even followed him into a few investments.\r\n​\r\nRecently, he decided to start a wealth management division to service the clients of his accounting firm.\r\n​\r\nFinally, I have someone I can confidently refer people to—someone I genuinely believe is both smart and ethical.\r\n​\r\nSo, if you need a guy, I recommend you speak to Jon Ronkai. I’d trust him with my life.\r\n​\r\nEmail him here: jronkai@arbutusgroupcpa.com\r\n​","title":"October 29, 2024","date":"October 29,

you're new here, welcome to Never Enough, where I brain dump interesting stuff that has been on my mind over the last week.\n\nEvery time I tweet about AeroPress, I get dozens of responses like this:\r\n​\r\n​\"When are you going to make a non-plastic version?\"\r\n​\r\n​Well, we've finally done it.\r\n​\r\nLast week, we released the AeroPress Premium, a gorgeous all metal and glass version and it's phenomenal. I've been testing one for the last month and I absolutely love it.\r\n​\r\nApparently, the world agrees, because we sold out in less than 3 hours.\r\n​\r\nYou can pre-order one in time for the holidays here.\r\n​\n\nHow business made me twenty best friends\r\n​\r\n​In 1938, the Harvard Grant Study began following over 700 men. They came from a variety of walks of life. Some would go on to become successful leaders, including John F. Kennedy, who would later become the 35th President of the United States. Others faced hardships, becoming homeless, or struggling with mental health issues.\r\n​\r\nFor eighty-six years, researchers have been following this cohort, interviewing them extensively. Doing medical examinations. Tracking things like physical health, mental well-being, and career progression. Even interviewing their wives, children, and grandchildren.\r\n​\r\n​The findings are fascinating:\r\n‍\r\nGood relationships make us healthier and happier.\r\nLoneliness is as deadly as smoking or

summarize: it's all about relationships. Marriage. Friends. Community.\r\n​\r\nAnd maybe stop drinking too.\r\n​\r\n​This summer, I read The Good Life, a new book by Robert Waldinger, the study's current director, and it drove this home. As I sat on the dock of my lakeside cabin, listening to my kids play on the beach, I pondered my relationships.\r\n​\r\nI had a wonderful girlfriend. A great relationship with my two boys. A core group of close friends, and a huge extended network of acquaintances. But oddly, some of my deepest friendships had come from...business?\r\n​\r\n​Why? Because I'd stumbled into group therapy, without ever intending to.\r\n​\r\n​Fifteen years ago, I joined the Entrepreneur's Organization. As part of joining it, you are inducted into a \"Forum\".\r\n​\r\nEvery month, you spend 3-4 hours in a conference room with six entrepreneurs. In it, you share your personal, family, and business problems. Highs and lows. What's going well, and what's not. It's the same group every time, and it's 100% confidential.\r\n​\r\nIn my group, everyone was initially quite guarded, sticking to business topics and mostly purporting to be doing great. But as trust grew over many months, conversations went deeper. People began sharing not just business challenges, but also the struggles and triumphs in their personal and family lives.\r\n​\r\nInitially, I wasn't sure what I could learn from this group. We all ran such different businesses. Most weren't even in tech. In my first group, the other entrepreneurs ran businesses completely different from my own: a puzzle company, a woodworking shop, a popsicle company, and a mapping company. But, as my friend Brent Beshores says, it turned out, \"in business, everything tastes like chicken\".\r\n​\r\n​Our problems were strangely universal. Over the years, we helped each other navigate:\r\n‍\r\nFailed partnerships\r\nBankruptcies\r\nDivorces\r\nFraud\r\nHealth scares\r\nToxic employees\r\nMental health struggles\r\nFamily deaths\r\nChallenges raising children\r\n‍\r\nSome of these forum mates have become my closest friends—so close that when I needed executors for my will, I chose them without hesitation.\r\n​​\r\n​For the past decade, I've run multiple groups, meeting nearly every week. I no longer do it through EO—I run them myself. I have four forums, dedicating one evening a week to each. It's a rhythm that keeps me sane. Like a small, secular church group—a weekly space for real connection. A guarantee that I'll get a chance to socialize, laugh, and get some stuff off my chest.\r\n​\r\nThere's something profound about sitting in a room, tackling shared struggles, and building trust over a decade. Forum has forged deeper friendships than any other part of my life—deeper than high school, college, sports, or meeting parents at my kids' school. In 15 years, it's given me over 20 incredible friendships I never expected.\r\n​\r\nIf you're an entrepreneur—or even if you’re not—I can’t recommend starting a forum enough.

new favorite possession: A Shotgun\r\n​\r\n​I recently solved a very silly problem for myself. When I let my dog out to pee in our backyard, I often leave the back door open and mosquitos and flys buzz into the house.\r\n​\r\nWe have high ceilings, so big, fat flies often spend days buzzing around our heads as we try to swat at them. Sometimes, out of frustration, I'll grab a towel or book and hurl it at the ceiling, but it almost never works.\r\n​\r\nEnter, the Bug-A-Salt. I found this thing on YouTube and it's amazing. It's an air-powered shotgun that shoots table salt.\r\n​\r\nPour in a teaspoon of table salt. Cock it. Aim at the bug. And boom, dead bug.\r\n​\r\nBe careful, by the way. You'll shoot your eye out!\r\n​\r\nYou can buy them on Amazon.\r\n‍\n\nTherapy for Nerds\r\n​\r\n​I've spent years in talk therapy on and off. I've tried it all: CBT, ACT, Jungian, Internal Family Systems.\r\n​\r\nIt's been really helpful in working through many issues. But I've often found myself craving a system.\r\n​\r\nAs a business and process nerd, I wanted something repeatable. When X happens, do Y.\r\n​\r\nThis year, I started doing Dialectical Behavior Therapy and it has really resonated for his exact reason. It's like therapy for business nerds: everything is just a flow chart.\r\n​\r\nYou feel upset with your partner? Overwhelmed? Irritated? At a loss?\r\n​\r\nDBT gives you a system of next actions to take for each.\r\n​\r\nHere's two principles I like:\r\n​\r\n​Do the Opposite - Break negative behavior by doing the opposite of what you feel. Follow these steps:\r\n‍\r\nIdentify the Urge - Notice the negative behavior you want to engage in.

Regulation - Manage emotions in a healthy way by following these steps:\r\n‍\r\nAssess the Situation - Identify what you're feeling and why. Is there an external trigger or internal thought causing the reaction?\r\nCheck Basics - Ask yourself if you've slept enough, eaten well, or are dehydrated. Physical needs can significantly impact emotions.\r\nBreathing and Mindfulness - Take deep breaths or practice mindfulness to calm your initial emotional response.\r\nDistract or Step Back - If you're still feeling overwhelmed, distract yourself with a different activity or take a break from the situation to gain perspective.\r\nPhysical Intensity - If emotions remain intense, engage in vigorous exercise or take a cold shower to physically alter your state.\r\nUse Medication if Appropriate - If you're prescribed medication, consider if it's the right time to take it (e.g., anti-anxiety meds).\r\n‍\r\nDBT is not holistic therapy. It's not going to help you work through childhood trauma or contemplate your family history. It's simply a model, for how to snap yourself out of unproductive habits.\r\n​\r\nI've found it really helpful and the \"do the opposite\" principle has definitely saved me from snapping in a few

few years ago, I was going through a really hard time.\r\n​\r\n​I was feeling listless and confused about what to do next.\r\n​\r\nI happened to be in New Zealand for a conference, and remembered that my friend Derek Sivers lived in Wellington, so I looked him up and we grabbed coffee.\r\n​\r\nThe next hour, was one of the most impactful of my life.\r\n​\r\nFor those who don't know Derek, he is one of the most thoughtful and interesting people I've ever met. An entrepreneurial Yoda who lives life according to his own rule book.\r\n​\r\nI recounted that story in one of the chapters of my book, Never Enough.\r\n​\r\nRecently, Derek and I spent an hour chatting. This time for my podcast. And as always, he was absolutely fascinating.\r\n​\r\n​We talk about:\r\n‍\r\nWhy he gave away his $22 million dollar fortune.\r\nWhy he's an explorer not a leader.\r\nHow he has \"burned the ships\"

you're new here, welcome to Never Enough, where I brain dump interesting stuff that has been on my mind over the last week.\n\nI get distracted easily. If I’m not careful, I’m easily led down rabbit trails and become unfocused across 20 browser tabs. Oddly, despite being easily distracted, I find that I work best from cafes.\r\n​\r\nI’ve always found the silence of a closed-door office overwhelming. Over the last twenty years, I’ve tried everything from fancy private offices, to buzzy open-concept spaces, to co-working, but nothing hits quite like cafes.\r\n​\r\nIn order to stay focused in a noisy environment, I rely on some guardrails to stay on track. Cafes can be loud and distracting, so I’ve always used my AirPods Pro to drown out the noise. Recently, I discovered a way to make this experience 10x better.\r\n​\r\nI’ve discovered an app that I absolutely love. It’s called Endel and it creates the perfect soundscape for whatever you’re doing. Ranging from work (deep work, afternoon energy drift, colored noise), to reading, to walking, it dynamically creates the perfect soundtrack to your day (even going so far as to use your heart rate from your Apple Watch to switch it up — super cool).\r\n​\r\nThere’re a million apps like this, but Endel is by far the best designed and executed.

you a rat or a frog? Zoe told me about this bizarre meme: all people can be divided into two groups: rats and frogs.\r\n​\r\nAs soon as you think about it, you’ll start laughing. Just start naming people you know and your gut will immediately tell you if they’re a rat or a frog.\r\n​\r\nMe: Rat​\r\nChris: Frog​\r\nZoe: Frog​\r\nOne of my sons: Frog​\r\nThe other one: Rat​\r\n​\r\nI can’t explain it, but it cracks me up. Try it, it’s hilarious.\r\n​\n\nWho knew being a trader at JP Morgan was so sexy and exotic? It’s not, but the writers of Industry would have you think it is.\r\n​\r\nRegardless, it’s a blast to watch, and definitely one of my favorite shows from the last few years. The third season just started and I’m loving it. It’s not dissimilar to Billions: lots of silly exaggeration and drama added to one of the world’s dullest jobs, but the cast is incredible and it’s a lot of fun to watch.

hosting an event for lonely conglomerateurs (yes, that is a word 🤢, and if you ever want to get punched in the face, introduce yourself as one).\r\n​\r\n​There are tons of support groups for executives and CEOs, but not for folks who run holding companies. It’s a unique role with a rare structure and set of challenges. And frankly, it’s often pretty lonely because there are so few people who can relate to your problems (of which there are many: perverse incentives, compensation negotiations, reporting complexities, etc).\r\n​\r\nIn fact, I so rarely meet people who I can talk to about these problems with that I’ve decided to do what I always do. If I can’t find my group, I build my own group.\r\n​\r\nSo, in January, I’m hosting the first of what I hope to make a bi-annual event exclusively for people who run at-scale holding companies. It’ll be hyper confidential, YPO forum format, and we’ll have folks from a variety of industries and scales.

you're new here, welcome to Never Enough, where I brain dump interesting stuff that has been on my mind over the last week.\n\n“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”\r\n​\r\n​I’ve always loved this quote by Arthur C. Clarke.\r\n​\r\nThink back to the first time you saw an iPhone or asked ChatGPT a question.\r\n​\r\nIt felt like pure, unadulterated magic, didn’t it? If you had traveled back in time and shown someone these technologies, they would probably burn you at the stake.\r\n​\r\nYet today, we use both without a second thought.\r\n​\r\nI still have moments with ChatGPT where I gasp in awe—like when it effortlessly analyzes 10 years of a company’s financial statements in seconds, or crafts a flawless paragraph that puts my own to shame. But mostly, it’s just become another tool in the toolkit.\r\n​\r\nI’m having one of these moments right now, with self-driving cars.\r\n​\r\nIf you’ve been following along for a while, you might remember when I posted a photo of myself grinning like an idiot outside of a Waymo in San Francisco. I had summoned it with an Uber-like app, and moments later, this futuristic taxi rolled up, unlocking itself for us. Zoe and I sat in the back, in complete shock as it expertly navigated left turns and unpredictable traffic.\r\n​\r\nWe couldn’t believe it. We shared videos with everyone we knew—it felt like magic.\r\n​\r\nBut this morning, I got into my Tesla, punched in my favorite café on the map, turned on AutoPilot, and leaned back to listen to a podcast.\r\n​\r\nI was completely unfazed. Self-driving has become my new normal. I rarely drive manually anymore. What was once astonishing has quickly become just another part of my day.\r\n​\r\nIt reminds me of COVID. During the lockdowns, I remember thinking, “I’ll never take being around people for granted again.” But once the restrictions were lifted, the elation lasted a few weeks before I returned to my baseline, taking human contact for granted once more.\r\n​\r\nToday, I’ve almost forgotten what that isolation felt like.\r\n​\r\nLife goes on. But we shouldn’t forget how insanely amazing the modern world is.\r\n​\r\nA self-driving AI-powered robot car is not something that should be taken for granted.\r\n​\r\n​PS: If you haven’t checked out Tesla’s Full Self-Driving technology yet, you should. It’s absolutely incredible. You don’t even need to hold the wheel anymore. As long as you’re paying attention and looking out the front windshield, it does everything.

I began writing Never Enough, I made a list of my favorite business books that I wanted to use as a benchmark for my own book.\r\n​\r\n​At the very top were two of my all-time favorites: Shoe Dog by Phil Knight and The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz.\r\n​\r\nThe other day, I received a surprising text from a friend: ‘Congrats on the review!’ I had no idea what he was talking about.\r\n​\r\nCurious, I quickly Googled my name—and my jaw dropped. My book had been reviewed in none other than The Wall Street Journal. THE business newspaper.\r\n​\r\nI’m not ashamed to admit that I let out a shriek of pure joy.\r\n​\r\nI couldn’t believe my eyes when I read the final paragraph of the review by Daniel Freedman:\r\n​​\r\n“Never Enough’ succeeds in a way that only a handful of business autobiographies do. It shares with the best of them, like Phil Knight’s ‘Shoe Dog’ and Ben Horowitz’s ‘The Hard Things About Hard Things,’ the virtue of providing valuable lessons in an entertaining format, all while being honest about the writer’s own shortcomings and failures.

funded an important study by Dr. Ashley Mason at UCSF that involves sticking thermometers up people’s rectums.\r\n​\r\n​Sorry, that was the only way I could guarantee to keep you reading. But seriously, keep reading, this is really cool.\r\n​\r\nIf you’re a Tech Bro™ type or have ever listened to Huberman Lab or Dr. Rhonda Patrick, then you’re well versed in the benefits of saunas and cold plunge, but it turns out that high temperature saunas may treat severe treatment resistant depression.\r\n​\r\nResearchers have long known that depression is often accompanied by a slight but consistent increase in body temperature. The question that intrigued scientists was whether changing that temperature could, in turn, alter the course of the depression.\r\n​\r\nEnter the sauna. Anecdotal evidence has suggested for years that regular sauna use can boost well-being, but only recently have researchers begun to look seriously at its potential to treat depression.\r\n​\r\nIn the study, for 8 weeks, participants with major depressive disorder were fitted with a rectal thermometers (unfortunately the most accurate way to measure body temperature when in a sauna) and exposed to extremely long (140 minute) weekly sauna sessions that raised their body temperature to a feverish temperature of 101.3 F.\r\n​\r\nWhat was incredible was that participants saw their symptoms significantly improve after just a few weeks of regular heat sessions. The effect was so pronounced that nearly all of them no longer met the criteria for major depressive disorder at the end of the trial.\r\n​\r\nThis isn’t to say that saunas are a silver bullet for depression—far from it. The studies so far have been small, and much more research is needed to confirm the results and understand the mechanisms at play. But the early findings are promising enough that researchers are calling for more attention and funding to explore this avenue further.\r\n​\r\nTo date, we have committed over half a million dollars to this project, with more to come.

used to be a terrible sleeper.\r\n​\r\n​I was an inveterate night owl and would often spend hours trying to fall asleep, anxiously tossing and turning.\r\n​\r\nWhen I had kids, I had to get real and figure it out. And for the most part, I did. I posted my key sleep tips on X a few years ago (check them out here), but all this talk about Dr. Ashley Mason reminded me about a sleep tip she gave me that has been a game changer.\r\n​\r\nA few years ago, over lunch, she mentioned that she used to run the UCSF sleep clinic—the place they send the worst of the worst, the insomniac’s insomniacs.\r\n​\r\nCurious, I asked her what the number one breakthrough was for her patients.\r\n​\r\nHer answer surprised me:\r\n​\r\n​She said most people simply sleep with a blanket that’s way too hot.​\r\n​\r\nTime and time again, she found that getting people to switch to a few thin woven cotton blankets (like this one—layered so you can adjust based on temperature) had the greatest impact on improving their sleep.\r\n​\r\nInterestingly, your body temperature needs to drop by about 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 1 degree Celsius) for sleep to initiate effectively. A hot blanket can prevent this from happening.\r\n​\r\nI decided to try it for myself and found that I fall asleep much faster.

first business was an agency, and running one is pure, unadulterated chaos—especially in the early days.​\r\n​\r\nWhy? Because the entire business is built around people. And as my business partner Chris puts it:\r\n​\r\n​“There’s no such thing as problems. Only people problems.”\r\n​\r\n​Almost daily, I receive emails or DMs from frazzled agency owners asking for advice on managing their businesses. I usually respond with a shrug.\r\n​\r\nThe truth is, I haven’t been involved in day-to-day agency operations for years.\r\n​\r\n​Metalab now has a fantastic executive team that has grown the company far beyond what I ever could. Honestly, if I worked there now, I’d probably get fired.\r\n​\r\nI was good at starting an agency but terrible at running one.\r\n​\r\nThat’s why I brought in Mark—my college roommate. You might remember the story from Chapter 4 of my book, but TLDR: Mark saved my bacon. He took over from me a few years in and grew Metalab into what it is today, leading it from 2009 to 2015.\r\n​\r\nMark’s a mensch who truly knows his stuff when it comes to agencies.\r\n​\r\nLast year, he retired from agency life, but boredom got the best of him.

you're new here, welcome to Never Enough, where I brain dump interesting stuff that has been on my mind over the last week.\n\nNever tell, always storytell.\r\n​A few weeks ago, I invited 80 exceptional people to Victoria for my second annual Interesting People conference. This year, we focused on storytelling. We had Matt Dicks, who has won The Moth an absurd number of times and has the ability to make even the most innocuous story bring tears to any audience’s eyes.\r\n​\r\nStorytelling is a superpower I've honed over the last decade. Too many people screw up by just dumping facts:\r\n​\r\n​“Here’s what my startup does. This is the market it’s tackling. Here’s the customer persona.”\r\n​\r\n​BORING. I’m asleep already.\r\n​\r\nWhat you should be doing is telling your story. Sharing your hero’s journey. Talking about your fuck ups and the chip on your shoulder. Helping others see themselves in you, feeling bought in.\r\n​\r\nMatt was incredible, and in just under 48 hours we had multiple people get up onstage and tell incredible stories with a bit of coaching from Matt.\r\n​\r\nIt’s not rocket science, and he breaks it all down in his new book on using stories in a business context.

friend Nick Gray MC’d the Interesting People conference. I think he’s one of the most interesting people I know, because instead of fixating on getting rich (which he has quietly become), he is focused on building a huge network of friends. He does this in an incredibly nerdy way, where he basically builds a funnel: ​\r\n​\r\nSocial Media -> Events -> Smaller Dinners -> Close Friendships.\r\n​\r\nI just interviewed him for my podcast and he walks through it all.\r\n​\r\nIf you’re feeling like you want more friends, then you need to check out this interview.\r\n​\r\n​Billionaire < Friend Billionaire. Check out the interview here.​\r\n‍​\n\nI often snap back to reality after 30 minutes of scrolling YouTube and wonder what happened. It’s my #1 time suck, and yet I don’t want to block it. It’s too useful.\r\n​\r\nSo, the other day I discovered UnTrap for YouTube. It’s really simple: when you go to YouTube.com, it redirects you to your history or watch later page. The idea being that you can’t go down the rabbit hole and instead either have to search for what you specifically want, or just view stuff you’ve previously saved to watch later.\r\n​\r\nI’ve found it’s really helped me cut down on YouTube time.

year, a few simple negotiations made Tiny shareholders enough extra profit to buy six Porsche 911s.\r\n​\r\n​If you own your business, every dollar of savings is a dollar in your pocket.\r\n​\r\nAccordingly, you're insane not to negotiate all your expenses.\r\n​\r\nOften all it takes is asking: \"Is that the best you can do?\" or sharing a quote from a competitor.\r\n​\r\nBack in the day, Chris and I used to negotiate everything.\r\n​\r\nOffice leases. Furniture. Software. Food for the office.\r\n​\r\nYou name it, we haggled and saved millions.\r\n​\r\nBut now Tiny is huge.\r\n​\r\nNow we only have time to negotiate the big stuff: incentive packages and M&A deals—high level capital allocation.\r\n​\r\nBut the little stuff still matters. Our companies collectively spend tens of millions a year with companies like Google, Zoom, Amazon, Microsoft, and all the usual suspects.\r\n​\r\nWe have over 40 companies and it's hard to incentivize employees to negotiate.\r\n​\r\nBecause let's be real: negotiating is stressful.\r\n​\r\nSo, this year, we started a new company to solve that problem. It's called TechSource and they do \"Negotiation As A Service\".\r\n​\r\nSound familiar? It is. We started a similar business called Buyer with our friend Kimia a few years ago and he ended up selling it to Ramp.\r\n​\r\nBut as soon as we sold it, we regretted it. We needed this service and our tech spend started creeping up again.\r\n​\r\nNow, we're back with TechSource.\r\n​\r\nThey're 100% focused on negotiating one of tech companies' and startups' biggest P&L expense items:\r\n​\r\nSoftware.\r\n​\r\nHere's an example of what they did for Metalab:\r\n​\r\nThey completely outsourced their software procurement process to TechSource and saved $72,000 in the first month and $264,000 annually in addition to saving employees over 40 hours of work that can now be allocated to billable projects.\r\n​\r\nGoogle: 27% savings\r\nJamF: 40% savings\r\nDrata: 85% savings\r\nZoom: 38% savings\r\n​\r\nThat's pure profit to the bottom line. And they aren't even finished yet.\r\n​\r\nI freaking love this business. It's such a no brainer for any founder that spends a lot of money on infrastructure and software.\r\n​\r\nYou literally just send them a breakdown of all your expenses and they get to

I’m sorry. I’m going to be a douche and ask you to do something.\n\nIt’s called Never Enough and it’s a memoir about building my business over the last twenty years. Going from a barista making $6.50 an hour, to being a billionaire (spoiler: I’m not a billionaire anymore). It was a crazy experience, and it was fun to put it all down in writing.\n\nI thought I was going to write a business book, but as I started writing it evolved into a deeply personal memoir.\n\nIt’s coming out July 9th and I want you to read it.\n\n“A massively important topic written by a guy with firsthand experience.

you’ve even remotely enjoyed my newsletter, it would mean a lot to me if you’d do me a favor and order a copy of my book. You can order one here, and if you forward a copy of your receipt to book@neverenough.com, I’ll send you a PDF list of my favorite books, questions, and products, as a thank you.\n\nAlso: if you happen to be in Victoria, Canada, I’m doing a book launch event at Bolen Books at 7PM on July 9th. You can grab tickets here (need tickets, but 1 ticket = 1 book at the event):\n\nDon’t worry. I’ll pause and wait while you go do that, then get on to the rest of the newsletter.\n\nTHANK YOU.\r\nOk, back to our regularly scheduled newsletter where I brain dump interesting stuff that has been on my mind over the last week..\n\nI work from cafes and hotel rooms a lot, and I often find myself hunching over my laptop in an awkward position. Then, my friend Codie told me about the Logitech Casa Pop-up Desk. It’s really cool. It looks like a little laptop case, and inside it has a bluetooth keyboard, a trackpad, and a laptop stand. In short: a desktop-like experience from anywhere you happen to be.

perception is a strange thing. When you’re in a routine, time rips by. Break the routine, and time slows down.\r\n​\r\nThere are a bunch of different ideas about why this is, but the one that makes the most sense to me is the theory that your brain is constantly mapping out the world and building models. It’s a prediction engine, and the more it can predict the terrain/people/experience, the fewer new memories it needs to form.\r\n​\r\nI read an interesting article about this phenomenon a month or so ago and it recommended changing things up to extend your sense of time. Drive a different route to work. Rearrange your desk. Vary your experience as much as possible.\r\n​\r\nMost days, Zoe and I take the dog out for a walk in our neighborhood. We’d typically do the same route. In an effort to mix things up (and expand our sense of time), I downloaded an awesome app called AllTrails. Basically, it’s a crowdsourced map of all of the best hiking/walking paths and parks in your area. Through it I’ve found dozens of parks I didn’t even know about, and we’ve been trying new ones every day.\r\n​\r\nOddly, this has added a sense of novelty to my life, I assume because my brain is building new models each time and therefore building more memories. It has made me oddly happy and become a fun new hobby: finding cool hidden natural beauty in my own city.

summer, I try to disconnect from all the noisy stuff and focus on reading. I recently read two books that I absolutely loved, both for different reasons.\r\n​\r\n1. Useful Not True by Derek Sivers - Derek is one of my favorite writers, and his latest book is focused on a simple idea: our beliefs are often not necessarily true, but simply useful to us. That beliefs are tools, not truths. They should be judged by how useful they are, not by how true they are.\r\n​\r\nI read it in one sitting and absolutely loved it. In fact, I liked it so much I trained ChatGPT on the book and started asking it questions to help me work through a few problems.\r\n​\r\nI highly recommend it, it’s a 1-2 hour read and it slapped me in the face. I also recommend Derek's other books (How To Live is especially good).\r\n​\r\n2. Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller by Ron Chernow - I’m reading this one for the second time, and I’m loving it. Here’s what I’ve found particularly interesting about it:\r\n​\r\n• Rockefeller was a walking contradiction: a brutal monopolist, yet deeply honest, religious, and generous in the rest of his life. This makes for a fascinating character study.\r\n​\r\n• The book offers valuable insights about philanthropy and how to do it effectively. Rockefeller single-handedly brought evidence-based medical research to the United States and generally gave to causes that compounded knowledge (universities/education/medical research). He was unique in his approach to giving: he did not seek to control or ask for credit, and largely left the non-profits he funded alone, even when he disagreed with them.\r\n​\r\n• The story serves as a great reminder of Mark Twain's observation that \"History doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme.\" Rockefeller's era faced concerns that echo today's issues: fears about a weak younger generation, the

found a t-shirt that I love. It’s made by Ecolygist, a brand based here in Victoria, and it’s nice and thick, and fits perfectly. I just bought a whole bunch of them. Check it out here.\r\n​\n\nI recently spoke with Ali Abdaal, a doctor turned entrepreneur, and the world’s most followed productivity YouTuber.

you're new here, welcome to Never Enough, where I brain dump interesting stuff that has been on my mind over the last week.\n\nEvery day, I’d feel the burning. First, the pressure in my stomach would build. Then the right side of my throat would feel like someone had a blow torch to it.\r\n​\r\nIt was acid reflux. And I had it almost every day for a decade. It started when I was about 25. Subtle, at first. I could take a Tums, and it would go away. No big deal. But before long, it became unbearable. The only thing that would prevent it was a ridiculously strict diet, and even then, I’d often have flare-ups.\r\n​\r\nWhat was odd about it was that the typical drugs did nothing. Tums made it better for 15 minutes, then it was back with a vengeance. And oddly, proton pump inhibitors, drugs that reduce stomach acid, made it twice as bad.\r\n​\r\nI was at a loss. Then, one day, I randomly stumbled on a Reddit community called “NoBurp.”\r\n​\r\nAll my life, I’d never been able to burp, and whenever I’d mentioned it to a doctor I’d been brushed off: “You’re burping, I promise you, you just don’t realize it.”\r\n​\r\nBut I wasn’t. I’d only burped a few times in my life, often at random moments when I was laughing really hard. (Which was as embarrassing as you can imagine.)\r\n​\r\nIt turned out that the people on Reddit all had an incredibly rare disorder called Retrograde Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction. Its primary symptom: the inability to burp, caused by an especially tight cricopharyngeal muscle. One of the most common symptoms: acid reflux and pressure in the throat after drinking carbonated beverages or a large meal.\r\n​\r\nI was intrigued.\r\n​\r\nIt seemed whacky, but I thought maybe this could be it. And there was just one doctor in the world working on it. A guy named Dr. Robert Bastian, in Chicago. After a Reddit user suffering from this disorder contacted him, he decided to try an experimental procedure: injecting Botox into the patient’s throat using an endoscope. Within a few days, this patient, miraculously, could burp, and Dr. Bastian began performing this procedure on hundreds of others, with most gaining the ability to burp. Here’s a great little YouTube video about a guy going through it.\r\n​\r\nSo in 2020 I flew to Chicago. Dr. Bastian and his team put me under, gave me the procedure, and within a day I was letting out little burps, then medium burps, then massive, room-shaking Homer Simpson burps. What was especially crazy was that I had absolutely no control over them, so they would erupt in the middle of a meeting or dinner out at a restaurant, which led to many awkward explanations.\r\n​\r\nMagically, my reflux almost completely disappeared, and three years later I’m still burping up a storm.\r\n​\r\nTo help more folks navigate this bizarre and rare disorder, I created a simple website walking through it: www.noburp.org.\r\n​\r\nCan you burp? If not, you might want to take a trip to Chicago too.","title":"June 18, 2024","date":"June 18,

friend Brent Beshore did a really wonderful interview on The Knowledge Project and I found myself nodding along. In it, he talks about some of the maladaptive behaviors that made him a superhero at work but challenged his personal life and distanced him from others. He was seeking control in all situations. Always paying for the bill. Always being the loudest in the room. Always ensuring he controlled all the variables and had everything planned out.\r\n​\r\nA quote that struck me: “Are you optimizing your life for the people who know you best, or the people who know you least?”​\r\n​\r\nIt reminded me a lot of some of the work I’ve done on myself over the last few years, and I really loved the interview.

years, I’ve been searching for the perfect overnight travel bag. My pal Rob at Outway teamed up with Haven bags and cracked it. It looks like a simple backpack, but it’s secretly HUGE and insanely well-organized. Highly recommend it. I've been traveling all week and loving it.\r\n​\r\n​Check it out here​\r\n​\n\nI’ve been loving Sam Parr’s new podcast, MoneyWise. In it, he goes deep (often anonymously) with wealthy people about their lives. How much they spend, what’s worth it, what isn’t. How money has impacted their lives and changed their relationships.\r\n​\r\nIt’s really unique and something you so rarely hear people talk about. I particularly liked this episode with “Jeff,” a guy who sold his software company for $120M, bought four houses and a jet, and then realized he was just as miserable as ever.\r\n​\r\nGreat quote from

a big fan of Ugmonk. They make insanely beautiful desktop organizer systems for anal retentive nerds.\r\n​\r\nI recently bought the Gather Productivity Kit and it has majorly upped my home office game (see below).\n\nMy book, Never Enough, is coming out July 9. If you happen to be in Victoria, BC, I’m doing a launch event, reading, and Q&A at Bolen Books that evening from 7-8:30pm. Get your tickets here (one ticket = cost of a book, which you’ll receive at the event). Hope to see you there :-)\r\n​\n\nThat’s all for this week…but one more thing.

you're new here, welcome to Never Enough, where I brain dump interesting stuff that has been on my mind over the last week.\n\nThe last thing I want to do is spend time calling the optometrist to get my latest prescription.\n\nLast year, I hired Tina, my Athena assistant, and tasks like this disappeared from view.\n\nWhen Tina stepped in, she took over my inbox and calendar, as well as my life. She was like a military general, ensuring nothing fell through the cracks and everything stayed on track.\n\nBut her true value shone in unexpected ways. She handled all the things that would otherwise sidetrack me.\n\nCoordinating car repairs. Keeping track of meeting notes. Coordinating legal documents.\n\nThe annoying little tasks that would otherwise eat away at my time.\n\nI stopped having to think about any of it, so I could focus on what really

magical about an Athena assistant, is they come pre-trained.\n\nThey know exactly what to do and come with opinions on how to improve your workflow. And somehow, they cost a fraction of a North American assistant.\n\nYou should ignore most problems.\r\n​\r\n​This morning, I left my phone in the car and took my dog for a walk in a wooded forest near my house.\r\n​\r\nWithin a few minutes, I felt calmer and more present.\r\n​\r\nInterestingly, at that moment, all of my life’s problems still existed. Hundreds of unread emails and texts piling up. Podcasts I’ve been meaning to listen to. Never-ending to-do lists.\r\n​\r\nI just wasn’t aware of any of it. It wasn’t in my face, blaring out of my trusty 6.7-inch portal into stress.\r\n​\r\nAbout six months ago, I used an app called Freedom to block all news and social media on my phone.\r\n​\r\nNow, when I try to click on news or open Instagram, Reddit, or X, my screen goes gray. I just can’t use any of it. Period.\r\n​\r\nI went from having an opinion on every stock market gyration and geopolitical event to not really being aware of any of it.\r\n​\r\nSure, I was loosely up to speed. I’d hear mutterings about what was happening from friends. I’d read the occasional copy of The Wall Street Journal. I knew enough to not embarrass myself at dinner parties, but, mostly, I’d focus on other problems. Things that I could actually control.\r\n​\r\nI knew Trump got indicted, and why, but didn’t know the details. I figured I would find out what happened in the trial after it concluded, instead of doing what I used to do: obsessively follow every second of it minute-by-minute in The New York Times.\r\n​\r\nIt felt like I knew enough to not have my head in the sand, but not so much that I was dwelling on it.\r\n​\r\nIn retrospect, I think this is the right amount of attention for most of life’s problems. And it’s interesting how often stress simply comes from awareness.\r\n​\r\nThink about that in the context of the stock market vs. home ownership.\r\n​\r\nMost people say they “can’t stomach” owning stocks because they go up and down. It’s scary. They’re a roller-coaster.\r\n​\r\nWhat they don’t realize is that—if they own a home—the same thing is happening to the value of their house. It’s just invisible to them.\r\n​\r\nThey’re not aware of it. There’s no ticker for a house price, even though home prices whip-saw around month to month, year to year.\r\n​\r\nThis lack of awareness doesn’t change the reality, but it does change the experience. You don’t stress over the daily fluctuations because you don’t see them. Your house might lose $50,000 in value one month and gain it back the next, but unless you’re trying to sell, it’s irrelevant to your daily life.\r\n​\r\nLately, I’ve been trying to remind myself to have as little awareness as possible of problems I don’t control and can’t impact, and as much calm space as I can from problems I do control.

Fried is my freaking hero. He’s built a massive company where he does exactly what he wants and runs it in a totally unconventional way. I’ve been a fan of his for decades and his company 37signals was a huge inspiration for how we built many of our own companies. I interviewed him on the podcast and the episode just went live.\r\n​\r\nWatch on YouTube or tune in on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.\r\n​\n\nI’ve spent the last decade reading the world’s greatest investors' annual letters. For those who don’t know, most public company and hedge fund CEOs write an annual (and sometimes quarterly) letter to their shareholders.\r\n​\r\nMost are boring as hell, verging on political fluff, but some are incredibly well written and informative. Warren Buffet being the most famous example. His letters are considered holy scriptures to value investors like myself, and it’s fascinating to start at the beginning of an investors career and see the progression (and compounding) over many decades. There’s a power to zooming out and seeing an investor’s long term trajectory. How their thinking changes over time. What stays the same. Which favorite investment in one letter turns out to be a blunder in another. The language they use to compliment (or covertly diss) management teams and competitors.\r\n​\r\nA few of my favorites that are worth checking out:\r\n​\r\n- David Einhorn from Greenlight Capital\r\n-

27, 2024\r\nIf you're new here, welcome to Never Enough, where I brain dump interesting stuff that has been on my mind over the last week.\n\nAthena isn’t just an executive assistant agency. It’s your ticket to unmatched efficiency.\n\nTheir EAs are productivity maestros. Through rigorous training, they become intuitive and proactive, tackling tasks before they hit your radar.\n\nImagine an assistant who anticipates your needs, makes smart decisions, and ensures nothing slips through the cracks.\n\nThat’s my Athena EA—part mind-reader, part productivity superhero.\n\nBest of all, Athena offers world-class talent at a fraction of the North American cost.\n\nOnce you experience their elite service, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it. Discover Athena at their website HERE.\n\nI started wearing makeup.\r\n​\r\nKind of.\r\n​\r\nI’m almost forty, and the thing I always thought I wanted to happen, has happened.\r\n​\r\n​I’m starting to look old.​\r\n​\r\nAs someone who didn’t have armpit or facial hair until the age of nineteen, I’ve always wanted to look older.\r\n​\r\nBut over the past few years, I’ve started going gray. Losing my hair. Seeing crow’s feet appear near my eyes, and I gotta say, I’m not a fan. It’s not the end of the world, but I’d prefer not to go bald and have my face slowly turn into a catcher’s mitt.\r\n​\r\nThis year, I vowed to start paying attention, and decided to do what I could to age gracefully.\r\n​\r\nOne of the easiest things you can do to reduce skin aging is to wear facial sunscreen. So, I bought some and started applying it every morning.\r\n​\r\nOddly, on the days I wore it, I kept getting compliments. My girlfriend would tell me I looked extra handsome. My friends would ask if I was doing anything different. I’d look in the mirror and think I looked better than usual.\r\n​\r\nIt turns out that I had accidentally bought tinted sunscreen. Sunscreen that had a bit of color in it and evens out skin tone. Kind of like a foundation.\r\n​\r\nI started wearing makeup without even realizing it.\r\n​\r\nAnd I loved it.\r\n​\r\nIt’s such a great aesthetic hack and I feel like it’s one of those things that I

does it feel like when a wire transfer for tens of millions of dollars hits your bank account? Kind of weird, according to Marshall Haas, who came on my podcast in a semi-shellshocked state the day after he’d just sold Somewhere (formerly Shepherd) for $53 million dollars. It’s a fun interview. YouTube / Spotify / Apple Podcasts​\r\n​\n\nI’m a bubbling pot of stress today and, as I think about it, I’ve realized that it’s entirely because of my calendar. Nothing overwhelms me quite like a packed calendar. It’s my white whale. The thing that I have never been able to tame or conquer.\r\n​\r\nI’ve tried a bunch of different strategies:\r\n‍\r\n2-3 hour booking window: Results: booked 4+ months out, important company issues or CEO calls get jammed in at the last minute, leading to 4-6 hours a day of meetings and no deep work.\r\n​\r\nNo calendar at all, just calling people: Results: massive call list I can never get on top of, and many people get offended when I won’t book with them.\r\n​\r\nUsing Calendly: Results: a lot of unwanted meetings booked into eternity.\r\n​\r\nI’m at the point where I’m ready to declare calendar bankruptcy and I want to tap you, my audience’s, collective intelligence.\r\n​\r\nThe core issue is that I am an inch deep and a mile wide. I oversee over 40 companies, I have hobby businesses, I’ve got 150+ minority investments, I’m trying to do a podcast and this newsletter, I have a broad ranging, highly extroverted social life, and I’m a father of two who often has to travel for work. TLDR: My ambition exceeds my time.\r\n​\r\nI’m curious to hear from other people who nod along with this and have significant work and personal responsibilities. How do you handle this? How have you prioritized? How do you delegate some of this?

is miserable. The last thing any of us wants to do is spend their afternoon calling their cable provider to negotiate ten bucks off a month, even if we know we’re probably being ripped off.\r\n​\r\nThat’s why I LOVE this startup I just found called CostCutter. You upload your bills, and they negotiate them automatically (I believe an AI voice agent calls and negotiates on your behalf).\r\n​\r\nThe future is terrifying, but this is one innovation I’m excited about: RoboNegotiators.\r\n​\n\nEasy choices will ruin your life. I’ve observed this time and time again.\r\n​\r\nLeaving the wrong person in the job because they’re your friend.\r\n​\r\nStaying in a toxic relationship out of fear of being alone.\r\n​\r\nHiring someone mediocre because you need someone ASAP.\r\n​\r\nWe’ve all been there.\r\n​\r\nI’m fond of this saying, which sums it up well:\r\n​\r\n​“Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life” – Jerzy Gregoric\r\n​\r\n​Today, I saw this illustration, which nails it.\r\n‍","title":"May 27, 2024","date":"May 27,

your business baby to a foster parent is scary. So, last week I went on My First Million and spent an hour sharing everything I know about hiring, transitioning, and managing CEOs. Enjoy. Here’s the episode on YouTube​\r\n​\n\nTwo Asks:\r\n‍\r\nI’m coming to Austin and New York June 10-15 to record some podcasts to promote my book. If you know any podcasters with a huge audience (top 500 podcasts) based in either city, please intro me!\r\n​\r\nI’m trying to get the finance teams across all of our companies to start utilizing AI tools. If you know somebody who trains/implements teams on AI tools, specifically in finance/accounting, please send me an email :-)​\r\n​\n\nThat’s all for this week…but one more thing.

been blown away. They're 1/5th the cost of a North American assistant, speak perfect English, and work the hours that you do.\n\nMaking things again feels unbelievably good. For the last three years, I’ve been working on a book and it’s been one of the most satisfying projects I’ve ever worked on. There’s something wonderful about crafting something physical—a creative act, a thing that will exist in the world for years, maybe decades, to come.\r\n​\r\nI used to create things every day. When I started my company almost twenty years ago, I was a designer. I’d put on headphones, drop into a flow state, and make something.\r\n​\r\nMockups. Logos. Websites. Code. You name it.\r\n​\r\nBut over the years, that happened less and less.\r\n​\r\nThis is the paradox of scaling a business.\r\n​\r\nIn the end, you no longer do the thing that started it all. The thing that brought you joy in the first place.\r\n​\r\nIt feels a bit like going from a soccer player on the field, to the captain of the team, to the owner of the team up in the owner’s box.\r\n​\r\nYou miss kicking the damn ball. The roaring crowd. Beers with the team afterwards.\r\n​\r\nWriting a book felt like kicking the ball again.\r\n​\r\nWhile I love business and all the problem solving that goes along with it, I’ve come to realize that I need individual side projects that I can pour myself into.\r\n​\r\nThat’s what this newsletter is: something creative and fun, where I don’t have to manage a team of people or field HR crises or negotiate raises.\r\n​\r\nI just turn on some good music and write for a couple hours.\r\n​\r\nAnd man does it ever feel good.\r\n​\r\nWhat’s yours?\r\n​\r\nPS: You can pre-order my book here.

it, you judge people on silly things.​\r\n​\r\nHow they do their hair.\r\nHow they dress.\r\nEven whether their text messages come in green (Android 🧐).\r\n​\r\nAnd yet, nobody seems to take Zoom hygiene seriously.\r\nMost people shoot a fingerprint-smudged webcam up their nose and bark into their laptop mic, which sounds like they’re broadcasting from an old Soviet spy transmitter.\r\n​\r\nNow there’s a way to look presentable on Zooms. Last year, I got this incredible little camera called the Opal C1 which seriously upped my game. It looks almost as good as a DSLR camera and has a wonderful bokeh (that beautiful blur around the object in focus) as well as a great built-in microphone.\r\n​\r\nGiven how many critical meetings we all do on Zoom these days, this seems like a no brainer.\r\n​\n\nI’d rather have a staple gun shot into my forehead than make small talk. I think most of you probably agree—nobody likes it.\r\n​\r\nIt sucks for them, and it sucks for you.\r\n​\r\nI recently discovered a hack, which I learned from David Brooks' new book How to Know a Person.\r\n​\r\nIt’s super simple:\r\n​\r\nWhen somebody brings up something that sounds even moderately challenging—a breakup, a difficult parent, an argument with a friend, something their boss did—even offhand—you just say these six simple words.\r\n​\r\n​“What was that like for you?”​\r\n​\r\nOr alternatively: “How did you feel when that happened?”\r\n​\r\nI’ve been astounded by how much this can deepen a conversation and cut away the small talk.\r\n​\r\nDoesn’t work on everyone, but when it does, it’s special.\r\n​","title":"Check them out today and tell them I sent you.

writing a book at age 92. I’ve been enjoying Fallen Leaves, a book that historian Will Durant wrote in his 90s, a summation of his thoughts on the meaning of life at the end of his.\r\n​\r\nI loved this quote about how humans persist over generations to ultimately achieve our goals:\r\n​\r\n“Three thousand years ago a man thought that man might fly, and so he built himself wings, and Icarus—his son—trusting them and trying to fly, fell into the sea. Undaunted, life carried on the dream. Thirty generations passed, and Leonardo da Vinci, spirit made flesh, scratched across his drawings (drawings so beautiful that one catches one’s breath with pain on seeing them) plans and calculations for a flying machine, and left in his notes a little phrase that, once heard, rings like a bell in the memory—“There shall be wings.” Leonardo failed and died, but life carried on the dream. Generations passed, and men said man would never fly, for it was not the will of God. And then man flew, and the agelong challenge of the bird was answered. Life is that which can hold a purpose for three thousand years and never yield. The individual fails, but life succeeds. The individual is foolish, but life holds in its blood and seed the wisdom of generations.

team's health is your company's wealth. Protect it with InsideTracker.\n\nI used to dress terribly. When I had kids, I basically gave up on looking good and took “athleisure” a little too seriously. I wore a uniform of a Patagonia jacket, black t-shirt, and black jeans. I didn’t look terrible, but I didn’t look particularly good either. I never put any effort into my appearance and as a result I noticed my self-esteem started to slip.\r\n​\r\nA couple years ago, I did something that sounds ridiculously expensive, but isn’t. I hired a personal stylist. Basically, I sent her a bunch of photos of me, then each quarter she’d send me a whole bunch of outfits and tell me how and when to wear them. For a couple hundred bucks, it really leveled up my style.\r\n​\r\nOver time, I graduated to the point where I felt confident choosing my own outfits and started buying my own clothes again. But I noticed something.\r\n​\r\nI’d get into clothing ruts. I’d end up wearing the same sorts of outfits, or sometimes I’d get stuck. What kind of shirt goes with khakis again?\r\n​\r\nThe other day, I tried something. I uploaded a photo of the outfit I was wearing to ChatGPT and asked: “Help me make this outfit better.”\r\n​\r\nIt filled the screen with ideas.\r\n​\r\n“Try wearing it with a pair of brown desert boots, a stainless steel watch, and a pair of black sunglasses, with your hair a bit more casual.”\r\n​\r\nSuddenly, my outfit was upgraded. My girlfriend even noticed.\r\n​\r\nFor the last week, I’ve been doing this every day. I’ll throw on a pair of pants or something and start asking for suggestions to go with specific outfits, or feedback on color combos—something I’ve always struggled with.\r\n​\r\nWho knew we all had a personal stylist in our pockets?

Vision Pro has been collecting dust on my kitchen island for the last few months. I’ll admit, I wasn’t a fan when I first got one. To be honest, I’m still not. Until recently, the only use case I could see using it for was watching movies on planes\r\n​\r\nThat is, until I tried Spacial FaceTime. Basically, you put on the Vision Pro, call a few friends on FaceTime, then tap a button to put it into “Spatial” mode.\r\n​\r\nI was sitting in my living room and suddenly, on the couch across from me, my friend Faisal’s ghostly head and ethereal body appeared. Sure, he looked like a very highly rendered video game character, but it was unmistakably him. Then Chris joined. Again, a perfect digital representation.\r\n​\r\nWhat astounded me the most was the eyes. It’s just insane. They move around perfectly, and you can make full natural eye contact with the people around you as you talk. It felt so much more personal than a Zoom call. We actually ended up hanging out and talking in my living room for almost an hour, and when I took off the headset I was shocked to realize that…I was sitting alone in my empty living room. My brain freaked out. It felt like they were there. Sure, they were weird ethereal ghosts, but it really felt like we were all sitting in the room together.\r\n​\r\nI can see so many amazing use cases for this. Hanging out with my kids or girlfriend virtually when I’m on the road. Playing board games with friends. Eventually, I’m sure there will be incredible ping-pong and tennis games. Imagine a virtual bar or social hangout where you can just walk up to people and start conversations. I think this could actually be a bit of a breakthrough—it just feels so much less lonely than texting and so much more intimate than a Zoom, where you’re just a box on a screen and you can’t make eye contact.\r\n​\r\nIt’s not quite there yet. This future is coming in a few years, but it was a really amazing taste of what’s to come.

years, I’ve been searching for the perfect pair of mens jeans. I’m happy to announce I’ve found my perfect match.\r\n​\r\nMost jeans are either groin-crushing, too stiff, too hot, or shrink unpredictably. After trying way, way too many (Japanese denim you have to hand wash, designer brands, Levis, custom made), I’ve settled on Duer jeans. They look like normal jeans, but they feel like sweatpants. Insanely comfortable, stretchy, and cozy, without looking like a schmoe. Thanks to my friend Ben Moore for the recommendation.\r\n‍\n\nIf you’re an investor in a lot of businesses, funds, and asset classes, keeping track of it all is a pain in the butt. In the past, my team has used Excel and it’s been a nightmare. They’d spend hours each month manually updating values and it was a pain to keep up.\r\n​\r\nWe recently switched to Kubera. Yes, there’s a bunch of ridiculously expensive solutions out there like Addepar. But want to know a secret? Addepar costs $100,000 a year. Kubera basically does the same thing and costs about $12/mo. It’s kind of insane.\r\n​\r\nTLDR: It’s a dashboard that shows you the current value (day-to-day) of all of your assets, presenting you with a breakdown of your current net worth, your investable cash position, and your assets broken down by class.

is when your body switches from running on glucose (blood sugar) to ketones (fat). But to get there, takes days. You basically have to either starve yourself (prolonged fasting) or eat a ridiculously high fat (keto) diet, but people say it feels incredible. Many report feeling cognitively sharper and more focused, with lower anxiety and more consistent energy.\r\n​\r\nI’ve tried Keto diets and fasting in the past, and I’ve loved the feeling, but I find it difficult to do regularly. So, for the past few years I’ve been experimenting with taking what are called exogenous ketones. Essentially, they are “ketone bodies”—the things your body produces when it’s burning fat in ketosis—except you’re taking them orally. They immediately put you into a state of ketosis for 2-4 hours.\r\n​\r\nI’ve been really enjoying Delta-G Tactical Ketones. I take them maybe once a week, but they are a great way to quickly get into the zone.

In my opinion, most messages could be a few bullet points, but many people (especially those who have too much time on their hands and lawyers and other professionals) write endlessly detailed emails that take forever to parse.\r\n​\r\nI’ve just solved this problem for myself, and it's insanely cool.\r\n​\r\nChatGPT has a new feature called GPTs. Essentially, you can create custom ChatGPT instances that are pre-prompted to be particularly good at a specific skill, communicate in a certain way, or even trained on a body of material. For example, someone made a HubermanLab GPT that is trained on all of the podcast transcripts—something ChatGPT wouldn’t otherwise be able to answer accurately.\r\n​\r\nI’ve played with this feature a little bit, but until recently hadn’t found it super useful…until I created my GPT Email Bot™.\r\n​\r\nIt’s super simple: I created a GPT that is trained on a bunch of sample emails that show my writing style. It’s instructed to:\r\n​\r\n1. Read the pasted email.\r\n​\r\n2. Ask me questions in a numbered list to address the key points the person is asking for feedback or answers on.\r\n​\r\n3. Use my answers to draft a response to the original pasted text as an email in my tone.\r\n​\r\nThis thing is a miracle. I had a whole bunch of long, complicated emails from various lawyers and accountants sitting in my inbox that I’d been avoiding for weeks. Now I just paste them in and it asks me clear questions about what they need feedback/next steps on. I respond to the bullets (much faster than writing a thoughtful email) and it spits out a perfectly formatted, thoughtful email.\r\n​\r\nBefore using this tool, I would:\r\n​\r\n1. Not respond for weeks, often slowing down critical projects.\r\n​\r\n2. When I did respond, I’d sound like a dick because I’d be super to the point.

day you’ve all been waiting for is finally here. We just launched colored AeroPress Clears and they are beautiful. To be honest, I wasn’t sure about this idea when I heard about it, but then I saw them. They turned out beautifully and add a nice dash of color to my kitchen. I particularly like the green. Check them out here.\r\n​\n\nI liked this quote from a recent interview with Mark Zuckerberg:\r\n​\r\n​“Most of the time, when we make a decision that ends up seeming good, it’s because we messed something up before and we just didn't want to repeat the same mistake.\" ​\r\n​\r\nEven Zuck is just failing upwards ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n​\n\nFor some reason this popped into my head today:\r\n​\r\n​One of the worst kinds of businesses is one that sells something to a price sensitive consumer.\r\n​\r\nMy nightmare business is a software company that creates software for school teachers to help them manage their class schedule.\r\n​\r\nWhy? Because the ultimate customer is a teacher. Teachers don’t make much money, and are often price conscious. They also have to pay for it out of pocket.\r\n​\r\nA big ticket software purchase for a teacher might be $9.99 per month.\r\n​\r\nSoftware of the same complexity, in a different niche, for somebody who uses it to make a lot of money, could cost 100x the price. And usually they just throw it on a corporate credit card. They rarely pay for it themselves. Total price insensitivity.\r\n​\r\nExample:\r\n​\r\nImagine if you instead made a simple software tool that helped hedge fund employees analyze a certain type of trade.\r\n​\r\nOr a niche tool that helped companies file some annoying government form that would deliver a $25,000 tax benefit.\r\n​\r\n​Nobody wakes up and thinks “I want to start that.” It’s freaking boring. And that’s why it’s a good business.

Trust me, it’s worth it.\n\nWhen my business was barely scraping by, I spent almost $20,000 to attend the TED conference.\r\n​\r\n​This sounds insanely irresponsible, but it was one of my best investments of all time.\r\n​\r\nI was a minnow. A nobody. I didn’t deserve to be there. But there I was.\r\n​\r\nI didn’t realize it at the time, but just being in that room would unlock my career.\r\n​\r\nAfter years of attending, when people needed an app or website designed, they went “Oh! What about Andrew, that guy from TED!”\r\n​\r\nI eventually landed a huge amount of work. Metalab even ended up building TED Connect, TED’s own app for conference attendees. Not by selling or schmoozing. Just by making friends—many of whom I’m still close with today.\r\n​\r\nI just got back from a week at my 15th TED event (since 2009) and I was reflecting on this.\r\n​\r\nI’ve found that surrounding yourself with successful people is one of the best ways to become successful yourself.\r\n​\r\nThere’s a saying: “you are the sum of your 5 best friends.” Well, you’re also the sum of your network. If you connect with a lot of great people, odds are you will become great too.\r\n​\r\n​\r\nA meeting that doesn’t result in action is a worthless meeting. A well run meeting should have an agenda, key takeaways, and action items. They hold people accountable and ensure that your company has a rhythm. They help you hold the bar.\r\n​\r\nThe problem is, I hate writing agendas and notes. I rarely remember to take notes and I’m often context switching as I jump from meeting to meeting.\r\n​\r\nI often find myself thinking “wait, I swear X person said they would do that” but I have nothing to back it up except for a faint recollection.\r\n​\r\nThat’s why I’m so excited about Limitless (walkthrough video here). It’s a little AI pin that records all your conversations and transcribes and analyzes them in an encrypted vault. It does all this automatically.\r\n​\r\nImagine the possibilities when fighting with a significant other!\r\n​\r\n​\r\nMy friend Jonathan Becker said something funny to me the other day:\r\n​\r\n​“Being successful in business is the art of being fucked over by other people, then getting back on the horse, over and over again, forever.”​\r\n​\r\nIf you’re a longtime entrepreneur, you'll laugh (or cry?) too.\r\n​\r\n​\r\nDo you live in Vancouver? Spending money rarely brings me joy, but one thing that brings me a ton of satisfaction is spending money on a beautiful space. A few years ago, I hired my friend Kate Snyder from Studio Roslyn to redesign my Vancouver apartment and went all out.\r\n​\r\nShe did an absolutely incredible job, and I’ve been enjoying until recently, when two things happened:\r\n​\r\n1. My girlfriend moved to Victoria, meaning I use it way less.\r\n​\r\n2. Bylaws changed and I can no longer rent it out on AirBnB.\r\n​\r\nSo, I have this insanely gorgeous, perfectly designed penthouse sitting empty 27 nights a month.\r\n​\r\nThis feels like a huge waste and I feel guilty. So I’m selling it or renting it out. If you’re looking for a perfect, turn-key home in the West End, then you should buy or rent it from me.\r\n​\r\nHere’s some photos of the interior details and the MLS listing, if you’re interested. I don’t necessarily need cash—I would accept equity in a wonderful cash flowing company as well ;-)\r\n​\r\nPS: Studio Roslyn, the firm that designed the apartment, is absolutely incredible and I’ve worked on a ton of projects with them. Highly recommend you go check them out.\r\n​\r\n​\r\nI’m doing a Shark Tank style pitch event on April 24th with Ryan Holmes and Michelle Romanow.

you're new here, welcome to Never Enough, where I brain dump interesting stuff that has been on my mind over the last week.\n\nToday's edition is brought to you by InsideTracker*.\n\nUgh. Yes. I know. Another Tech Bro “biohacker” thing. But this one might have extended my life by a decade or more (because of it, I have reduced my risk of Alzheimer’s disease, heart attack, and stroke risk).\n\nNo, it doesn’t involve healing crystals or anti-aging supplements. This one is insanely simple:\n\nEvery 4-6 months for the last eight years, a phlebotomist comes to my house and draws some blood.

check it out here. I’ve done a special deal with them where you’ll save 25% if you click this link.\n\nI just launched my podcast. I’m fortunate to get to talk to interesting people for a living, and after 20 years of it I figured I should start recording some of these conversations. Go check out the first episode with my friend Sam Parr, host of My First Million, here:\r\n​\r\n​Spotify / Apple Podcast / YouTube​\r\n​\r\n​\r\nI treat myself like a drug addict. But not with drugs, with my phone.\r\n​\r\nI have no self-control. I’ll often be enjoying a quiet moment reading a book or looking out at a view and suddenly, without even realizing it, I’m clawing for my phone in my pocket to check my Twitter feed.\r\n​\r\nAfter listening to this interview with Dr. Anna Lembke, I realized that you can become addicted—in the same sense you would to drugs or alcohol—to anything that stimulates dopamine.\r\n​\r\nThis can be your phone. Chocolate cake. Fizzy water. You name it, if it stimulates dopamine, you’re hooped.\r\n​\r\nIn the interview, she goes on to say that the effective treatment protocol for drugs and alcohol (6-8 weeks total abstinence) is the same way to treat things like phone or video game addiction. She talks about “self-binding,” the forced removal of the stimuli from your environment.\r\n​\r\nDon’t want to eat chips? Don’t keep them in your house.\r\n​\r\nWell, the same applies to phones. What I ended up doing was going into my iPhone’s Screen Time settings, blocking all the distracting stuff that causes me stress or I scroll endlessly, then having my girlfriend set the passcode.\r\n​\r\nThis means that, in order to use email, Twitter, check the news, Reddit, etc, I need to bug my girlfriend for the code.\r\n​\r\nAs Dr. Lembke predicted, the first 6 weeks were tough, but now I don’t even miss them. And I prevent myself from going back down the rabbit hole by continuing to keep the aggressive Screen Time enabled.\r\n​\r\nI’ve found that my life is much happier without scrolling feeds and current events. I’ve managed to replace most of my scrolling time with reading books or long-form audio and I haven’t found that not having email, news, or social media at close hand has in any way negatively affected me.\r\n​\r\nYou should try it.​\r\n​\r\n​\r\n“Civilization begins with order, grows with liberty, and dies with chaos.”​\r\n​\r\nThat’s a line from one of the most profound books I’ve ever read, The Lessons of History by Will and Ariel Durant. In just 128 pages, it summarizes the key lessons of human history in paired-down prose. Talk about cutting to the chase.\r\n​\r\nHere’s a few key ideas from the book:\r\nHistory repeats, driven by unchanging human nature.\r\nGeography molds civilizations' fates.\r\nClass struggles fuel

pal David Senra just did a great episode on this book on his (incredible) Founders podcast here. If you haven’t listened to Founders yet, you are missing out. Each week, he summarizes a great book and ties its lessons to other great books and leaders.\r\n​\r\n​\r\nMy friend Mark Nichols said something that struck me the other day:\r\n​\r\n​“There’s friends for reasons, for seasons, and for life.”​\r\n​\r\nWhich are your friends?\r\n​\r\n​\r\nHiring a CEO is a weird skill. Not that many people have done it, and those who have have only done it once (most people either run their company for life or only pass the baton once and then retire). Chris and I have done it dozens of times, and my inbox is often packed with people asking me questions about how to transition their company to a CEO. I finally broke down and wrote a little PDF on it for my paid Twitter subscribers. If you want to check it out, go to my Twitter profile and click the purple “Subscribe” button, then check out this subscriber-only tweet.​\r\n​\r\n​\r\nYou are probably a jerk in some way. We all are.\r\n​\r\nBut if you’re anything like me, you aren’t all that aware of it. You warp every situation to give yourself the most charitable interpretation. Our brains do our best to protect our egos. It's not fun to look at the darker sides of your personality.\r\n​\r\nThis is a highly adaptive aspect of humanity. It enables us to get through life. But ignoring your flaws is no way to become the optimal version of yourself. At work, we all understand the value of 360 reviews. Deeply understanding how we are affecting those around us and how we can improve. Pain + reflection = progress.\r\n​\r\nA few years ago, my friend Mohnish Pabrai told me about a psychologist named Jack Skeen who had done a 360 review on his entire life. It sounded fascinating: he did a deep dive on every part of his day-to-day life. How he perceived himself. How his family and wife perceived him. His co-workers. His friends. As a result, he said that he changed his entire life.\r\n​\r\nIt sounded kind of interesting, so I hired this guy, Dr. Jack Skeen.\r\n​\r\nHe spoke with my closest friends, my wife, my co-workers, and we spent hours on the phone together.\r\n​\r\nHe'd ask me weird uncomfortable questions like:\r\n​\r\n\"Are you a good person?\"\r\n​\r\nAnd\r\n​\r\n\"What is your purpose?\"\r\n​\r\nAnd\r\n​\r\n\"Are you well liked?\"\r\n​\r\nWith long, awkward silences on the other end of the line to make me squirm, while he took notes.\r\n​\r\nI also did a series of multiple choice personality tests\r\n​\r\nAll in all, it probably took 6-8 hours of my time, with another 10 hours of interviews across all my friends and colleagues.\r\n​\r\nWhat came out of it was brutal.\r\n​\r\nIt was a complete picture of me...including all the horrible stuff. It was chock full of gut wrenching feedback and anonymized comments from the people who knew me best.\r\n​\r\nThere were lots of positive things too, but it was a shit sandwich. Positives wrapped around the stuff nobody wants to read.\r\n​\r\nHere's a few:\r\n​\r\n\"He is quite hard to work with. He is a terrible manager. He never gives positive feedback.\"\r\n​\r\n\"He is oblivious of how he comes across to others.\"\r\n​\r\n\"He needs to do the hard work of 'real' relationships. He can drop people when the work gets hard.\"\r\n​\r\n\"Sometimes I feel like he's acting in social situations.\"\r\n​\r\n\"I get the impression often that Andrew isn't happy.\"\r\n​\r\nAs I read the report, I felt like I was going to hurl.\r\n​\r\nI immediately regretted it, and it put me into an existential tailspin. One of the key insights from the report was something I had felt but never quite put my finger on.\r\n​\r\nI scored high on the \"histrionic\" scale…\r\n​\r\nSomething I had never heard of.\r\n​\r\nTLDR: Behaving in a histrionic manner = essentially being able to \"perform\" for others, craving attention, and wanting short term gratification.\r\n​\r\nFortunately my score wasn't so high that it was a serious problem (for some people, it's a full on personality disorder and it ruins their lives), but it felt apt.\r\n​\r\nI'd noticed this in myself. That I could be dying inside, miserable, but when I needed to I could perform.\r\n​\r\nThis was an incredibly valuable business skill. It helped me deeply connect with people and build positive relationships, but what I came to realize was that it was actually draining my life force. I'd arrive at a meeting I didn't want to go to and LIGHT UP, putting on my mask. Big smile. Firm handshake. Asking all the questions. Making the other person feel good. Tap dancing. Faking it.\r\n​\r\nBut inside, I was secretly sad. I was being inauthentic. Something I had learned to do, for some reason, in my childhood.\r\n​\r\nI was an expert of wearing a mask, and it was making me profoundly sad.​​\r\nThere were a ton of other insights like this— some so personal I won't share to 20,000 people on the internet—but it all culminated in me making huge changes to my life…​​\r\nI got divorced.\r\nI completely changed my day-to-day life.​\r\nI started focusing on different things at work.\r\nI changed the way I interacted with friends.\r\nStopped wearing the mask.\r\n​\r\nYou name it, this psychological \"Roadmap\" I did with Jack Skeen rocked my world. It's been a few years now, but it's still one of the most impactful things I've ever done. It felt like 10 years of therapy in one month.\r\n​\r\nI know it sounds scary, but I highly recommend doing it yourself, if you can handle it: www.jackskeen.com​\r\n​","title":"For example because of

you're new here, welcome to Never Enough, where I brain dump interesting stuff that has been on my mind over the last week.\n\nToday's edition is brought to you by Write of Passage*.\n\nThis is the last week to enroll in David’s writing bootcamp – Write of Passage.\n\nThey only host this program 2 times a year, so if you want support improving your writing skills, now is the time. Otherwise, you’ll have to wait until their next cohort in September.\n\nI wouldn’t be sharing this with you unless I knew they were the real deal. There are a lot of bad courses out there, this isn’t one of them.\n\nThey are closing registration this week. If you want to up your writing game, enroll here.\n\nWhen you die, your stories die with you. The reality is that very few of us know much about our grandparents, let alone our great grandparents. How crazy is that? The history of your family just disappears into the ether. All of your collective knowledge and values. The struggle they went through to get you where you are today. Poof—GONE—within a generation or two. Sure, there’s usually some great uncle who puts together a family tree or something, but the actual lives and stories of those who came before you disappear.\r\n​\r\nLast year, I gave my parents Storyworth for Christmas. It’s a really cool service run by my friend Nick Baum. Each week, it sent them a prompt like “What is your first memory?” or “What was your father like?” It resulted in a few cool stories, but unfortunately neither parent stuck with it. After a few months, they got lazy and started to ignore the emails.\r\n​\r\nAround that time, I met a local entrepreneur named Andrew Hall who started a company called No Story Lost. Think of it as the white glove version of Storyworth. They hire a writer to interview your family members and then write a book about their life.\r\n​\r\nI just got a copy of my father’s and it comes in at an astounding 50,000 words. Despite having spoken to my father more than almost anyone in my life, there were so many stories about his childhood and life that I’d never heard, and I’m so excited for my sons and their future children to be able to to get to know my father and glean some lessons from his life.\r\n​\r\nCheck out No Story Lost, it’s such a great service.\r\n​\r\n​\r\nIn 2017, Elon Musk announced Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” software and predicted that there would be a million Tesla Robo Taxis on the road within a few years. I fell for this hook line and sinker. I bought a new Model S and paid thousands of dollars for the upgraded software. Then, I hit the “autopilot” button and realized it was…cruise control. And not even a particularly good one, it would often try to drive me into highway dividers. I gave up on the self-driving dream and felt that maybe the self-driving future was all fluff. The flying car of the 2010s. Last week, I found out I was wrong when I got to ride around San Francisco in a Waymo.\r\n​\r\nIf you haven’t tried it, you need to. It felt like using an iPhone for the first time. They have an Uber-like app, and magically a little robot taxi shows up and takes you to where you’re going. The driving was flawless. If I hadn’t looked into the front seat, I would have thought there was a human driver there. Even my girlfriend, who is never impressed by technology, was blown away.\r\n​\r\nNow, Tesla has also made some strides. I recently got to try out their new AI-trained Full Self Driving version 12.3.2 and was very impressed. Elon also just announced their Robo Taxi service is coming (we’ll see…). I think within the next year, self-driving cars will be somewhat mainstream and it will be fascinating to watch all these companies duke it out.\r\n​\r\nIf I shorted stocks, I’d short Uber.\r\n​\r\nIf

Kahneman, who made many huge contributions to the field of psychology, died last week. He was the first to admit that, despite knowing everything he knew about bias and decision making, he still fell prey to all of the same influences we all do.\r\n​\r\nYesterday, my friend Shane Parrish reminded me of this rule Kahneman made for himself, which all of us yes-prone calendar optimists should likely implement:\r\n​\r\n​“Never say yes on the spot. Always give yourself some space. Make it a rule. Tell people.”\r\n​\r\n​I absolutely love his 2010 TED Talk, which changed how I think about travel forever.​\r\n​\r\n​\r\nMy business partner, Chris, has a saying “Stress is like water: it will find its way to you.” Avoid phone calls? Your email will blow up. Avoid email? Your texts. Over the past year, as I’ve spent less time in my inbox, my text messages have gone crazy. I’m a huge fan of Texts.com on the desktop (which lets you combine Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage into one super fast interface), but one of my pet peeves has been that if I miss an iMessage on my phone and if it slips below the first few scrolls I’ll sometimes have an unread badge I can’t get rid of on my home screen. When I discovered that there’s an iPhone setting that allows you to filter by unread, it was a (incredibly boring and nerdy) gift from the gods.​\r\n​\r\n​\r\nI’m a huge fan of hiring remotely, and hiring in Latin America and The Philippines is roughly 1/5th the cost of hiring in North America. My best experience has been withAthena. TLDR: They hire virtual assistants, train them to be world-class, manage them, and you get an expert assistant who will not only help with your work, but teach you how to improve your workflow and delegate more effectively. The cost is higher, about $3,000/mo vs $1,000/mo if you trained/managed them yourself, but it’s well worth it. I’ve been using an Athena assistant for about 6 months now and she’s absolutely incredible.

you're new here, welcome to Never Enough, where I brain dump interesting stuff that has been on my mind over the last week.\n\nToday's edition is brought to you by Write of Passage.\n\nLast week, I shared how writing online has been a game-changer for my career and mentioned David Perell's writing bootcamp as a fast-track to supercharging your writing skills.\n\nIt’s no walk in the park. It's tough, and that's what makes it great—it weeds out the casuals and cultivates a community of folks who are serious about getting better.\n\nBut hey, don't take my word for it. David's made it easy for you to look into the program and its community by connecting you with some of his past students.\n\nSo, if you're committed to taking your writing to the next level this year,

here to setup a chat with a Write of Passage alumni.\n\nMy hairline is receding and I’m going gray. For the first time in my life, I’m feeling…old. At 38, I’m around my life’s halfway point and I decided to reflect back on some lessons I’ve learned over the past 38 years.\n\nHere’s a list of 38 things I’ve learned in the last 13,952 days of my life so far:\n\nIf you’re nice to someone, they’ll probably be nice back.\n\nCriticizing someone’s ideas will only cause them to double down.\n\nFind out what someone loves to talk about, then ask them questions about it. They will light up.\n\nPeople generally do what they’re incentivized to do.\n\nIf someone seems upset, repeat back what they just said. They will usually calm down.\n\nDon’t let people you dislike give you gifts or do favors for you.

is too busy thinking about themselves to notice the pimple on your nose.\n\nEvery time you say something out loud, your brain pounds it in a little further. Be careful what you say.\n\nIf someone gossips with you, they’re probably gossiping about you with others.\n\nEveryone other than your closest friends and family subconsciously want to see you fall in the mud. It’s not intentional, it’s human nature: the nail that sticks up gets hammered down.\n\nYou will want the things your ten closest friends want. Choose friends accordingly.\n\nThe things with the greatest mental payoff are generally the same things that would have made a hunter gatherer happy: exercise, being in nature, laughing with friends,

always wins over extravagance. Don’t count your poker chips at the table.\n\nNobody wants to hear about how bad your day is going.\n\nBe nice to people on your way up. You might meet them again on your way down.\n\nHalf of having friends is just being reliable. Say “yes” at least 70% of the time. Be on time. Respond to texts and calls.\n\nLeave some money on the table. You don’t need the last dollar.\n\nWant to get invited to cool parties and dinners? Host them.\n\nBeware of people who are rude to waiters and service staff.\n\nEmail people you admire. Sometimes they’ll respond and good things will happen.\n\nThe best way to avoid mistakes is to read about the mistakes of others.\n\nAlcohol and drugs are like an elastic band.

of psychopaths and narcissists like poisonous spiders. You don’t want them anywhere near you, especially not your bedroom.\n\nAlways default to picking up the bill, especially if you can afford it.\n\nWhales only get harpooned when they surface. If you don’t want to get harpooned, stay quiet.\n\nIdeas are like tiny embers. They require immediate oxygen to turn into a fire. Take action.\n\nDon’t judge old people for having views you disagree with. In a few decades, your liberal views will seem conservative, and that will be you.\n\nGoing back thousands of years, every generation thinks the next generation is weak and the world is doomed. Keep that in mind when you read the news.\n\nWhen a child is upset, get down to their level, validate their feelings, and touch their face with the palm of your hand.

He built his dream house, and a few days after moving in, his wife started feeling violently ill then  collapsed. They soon learned that she was suffering from severe formaldehyde poisoning. After investigating, it turned out that their super energy efficient passive house, which used as little energy and electric ventilation as possible, didn’t have enough airflow.

I heard David’s story, I was about to move into a new home. I immediately installed a bunch of air quality sensors and it turned out that my then-infant son’s new room was filled with crazy high levels of volatile organic compounds. This was especially concerning given that small children are particularly vulnerable to VOCs.\n\nThis is one of those profoundly boring, pernicious things that nobody thinks about. We obsess over plane crashes and falls, but we ignore the boring stuff like slow but steady exposure to toxic chemicals over the course of decades which could result in cancer, allergies, or learning disabilities. Air quality really matters.\n\n• Install Awair sensors in the rooms my family spends the most time in (especially children’s bedrooms and playrooms).\n\n• Keep windows open or ventilation fans running

Place HEPA filters in each room you spend a lot of time in. I am a huge fan of the Dyson Big + Quiet BP04, which tracks Co2 and filters formaldehyde, while looking like a beautiful robot from the future. An excellent cheaper option is the CoWay Airmega.\r\n‍\n\nI used to hate executive recruiters and refused to use them. Why would I pay someone $60,000 to connect me with an employee I could find myself on LinkedIn?\n\nBut I was wrong. Recruiters can be a tremendous asset. Here’s why.\n\nWhen you run a business, you’re distracted. And most entrepreneurs are like me, high pace, distracted, and trying to put out fires. One of the biggest fires is often hiring. You need someone to run X, Y, Z initiative at your company, and every day you don’t have them hurts.

I have the recruiter conduct all the initial interviews and record the Zoom videos. This means that I can quickly skim each video and do a quick vibe check. Do I think I’d click with them? Do I like the way they present? This is a massive time saver. We all know what it’s like to get 10 minutes into an interview only to realize the person is a dud, then feel obliged to stay on and ask them more questions to avoid being rude. This solves that. The recruiter spends the time, you skim the videos.\n\n2. The recruiter keeps the ball moving forward. The recruiter doesn’t get paid in full until they find you your person, so they naturally keep the process moving behind the scenes, even if you get sidetracked.

The recruiter widens the funnel. Yes, we often hire candidates that we found ourselves, but the recruiter often adds additional candidates that we never would have found. For example, when we were hiring a CEO for AeroPress, the recruiter found us Gerard Meyer, who was 5x more experienced than every other candidate. He just wasn’t on our radar.\n\nLet’s think about the cost of a recruiter. Say you’re hiring a CEO or top level executive for $300,000 per year.\n\nThe cost of the recruiter will be around $60,000 (20% of first year salary).\n\n- Widen the funnel and give you more optionality\r\n- Save you 10-15 hours of interviewing people you’d reject within the first 5 minutes anyway\r\n- Keep the process moving, even when you’re busy.\n\nIn the case of a high level hire,

note though: most recruiters are really annoying. They want to do weekly update calls and don’t record their Zoom calls. It’s a very old school industry and you need to ensure you work with modern firms that will be scrappy and take up as little of your time as possible.\n\nTighe Burke from SRCH Partners for large CEO/VP hires.\n\nMatt Hollingsworth from Align for SMB CEO/VP/Exec hires.\n\nThat’s all for this week…but one more thing.

25, 2024\r\nHey everyone,\r\n​\r\nIf you're new here, welcome to Never Enough - where I share some of my best recommendations.\n\nToday's edition is brought to you by Write of Passage. ​\r\n​\r\n​I’ve made some pretty good investments in my career, but publishing my ideas online is arguably the best investment I’ve ever made. Most of the opportunities I’ve encountered over the years have come from interesting people reading my writing and reaching out. It’s how I’ve met some of my best friends and business partners.\n\nIf you want to follow suit, I recommend following David Perell on Twitter (X). He has a lot of great content on this topic, but I’d get started here. He calls it: How to Build A Personal Monopoly By Writing Online.*​\r\n​\n\nThis is a bit weird to admit, but I’m an incredibly anxious person. I constantly expect the worst, obsess over it, and planning is my way to calm my anxiety.\r\n​\r\nOver the past two decades, this anxious planning has helped me grow my business and be successful, but a few years ago it got to the point where I was making myself miserable and actually causing problems at work. I couldn’t even watch a movie without pausing multiple times to fire off an email I was stressing about. I wasn’t present during family vacations and was irritable in meetings. I lived in the future. A terrible, anxious nightmare where all of my companies were failing, my kids had suffered horrible accidents, and everyone hated me.\r\n​\r\nI tried just about everything. Yoga. Meditation. Sauna and cold plunge. Exercise. The only thing that worked was alcohol, and we all know how that ends (I almost entirely quit drinking about 10 years ago).\r\n​\r\nFinally, I gave up and asked my doctor to prescribe me an SSRI (Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor), but I couldn’t bring myself to take it. The pill pack sat beside the sink for months, taunting me.\r\n​\r\nI was scared. While I’d heard incredible testimonials from some friends who took them, I’d also heard horror stories from others. I worried it could turn me into a zombie, devoid of emotions. That it might take away my fire.\r\n​\r\nOf course, my anxiety problem continued, so I did a deep dive into the science behind their side effects and found a paper about how different people metabolize SSRIs. It turned out that certain people have a genetic mutation, where some SSRI drugs spike to crazy levels in their body, causing far worse side effects. Odder still, my doctor wasn’t aware of this, nor were many of my friends who had experienced bad side effects. I ran my 23andMe genetic data through an analyzer and found that I was an SSRI “slow metabolizer” and likely would have suffered these side effects.\r\n​\r\nI found a new drug that was metabolized on a different pathway called Vortioxetine. It's the newest class of anti-anxiety/depression medications and works differently from medications like Prozac and Escitalopram. Not only does it not spike drug levels in slow metabolizers (people whose bodies break down certain medications more slowly, leading to a buildup of the drug in their system and potentially causing more severe side effects), but it doesn't appear to cause sexual side effects.\r\n​\r\nThree years ago, after almost a year of deliberation, I gulped and took the pill.\r\n​\r\nTo my surprise…I didn’t turn into a zombie. In fact, the opposite. Slowly, over the course of a few weeks, I felt my anxiety abate. It didn’t go away, but it felt like the volume had been turned down 50%. And a few months later, when I thought about some of the things I’d been anxious about before, I laughed them off. It felt like being reminded of being insecure in high school or something: “I can’t believe I was so worked up about that!”\r\n​\r\nTaking Vortioxetine has had a profoundly positive effect on my life. I’m a far happier person now and enjoy my days so much more. Rocks feel less like boulders. Things feel manageable and I’m more present. Don’t get me wrong. It’s not a panacea. I still get stressed and experience anxiety, but it’s just way less overwhelming. Best of all, I haven’t experienced any major side effects. Occasional nausea if I take it on an empty stomach.\r\n​\r\n​Maybe an over share, I know, but I wanted to share my experience for three reasons:​\r\n​\r\n1. I know so many people who suffer from crippling anxiety, but are scared of taking a pill. I thought maybe sharing my story would help them consider it as an option. *Do your own research. I’m not a doctor.​\r\n​\r\n2. Nobody seems to be aware of this slow metabolizer issue. If you have 23andMe, check this part of the test to find out if you’re a slow metabolizer. If you are, you might want to consider Vortioxetine (brand name Trintellix/Brintellix).\r\n​\r\n3. There is so much silly stigma against talking about this. For some reason, if you have seasonal allergies and take an antihistamine (which affects your brain too), nobody thinks twice about it. But when it’s for anxiety, you’re weak or insane. F that.\r\n​\r\nI just got back from an amazing week on the north shore of Kauai, Hawaii. I had previously only been to The Big Island and Maui, but Kauai absolutely blew me away. Easily one of the top 5 most beautiful places I’ve been.\r\n​\r\nA few spots/activities I loved:\r\n​\r\n- Java Kai for coffee and breakfast\r\n- Nourish for lunch (great acai bowls)\r\n- Bar Acuda for dinner (try the lamb chops)\r\n- Zip-lining at Koloa\r\n​- E-foiling lessons (sans Zuck sunscreen face mask) - yes, I went full Tech Bro™\r\n- I stayed at 1Hotel Hanalei. Great rooms and service, but I’d go elsewhere for food. Easily the nicest view I’ve ever experienced from a hotel.\r\n​\r\nYears ago, when I was thinking about selling one of my old companies, I had no freaking clue how to get started. I didn’t even know what an investment banker was. Someone who works at the bank??? What are the options? Who do I talk to? How will someone value the business? What I really wanted was security. I wanted to have enough money in the bank that I could pay off my house and buy a nice car, but I thought that meant selling my whole business.\r\n​\r\nNow I know there’s a gazillion options. Everything from raising equity, to dividend recaps, to even selling the business to your employees with management buyouts.\r\n​\r\nBut even today, I want to tear my hair out when I talk to investment bankers: “What can you do for me???” I want to scream (but don’t). I wish they’d just show me a menu showing me all the options and explain it in layman's terms.\r\n​\r\nFinally, Chris and I got frustrated. We met Louis, a young investment banker who was…shockingly normal and nice. A lot like us. The three of us partnered up to start our own investment bank. It’s called Tenzing and it’s built by founders, for founders.\r\n​\r\nIf you’re thinking about de-risking and taking money off the table, selling your company, raising debt, or even a management buyout (selling to your employees), then you should email him: louis@tenzing.co\r\n​​\r\nAnytime Bill Gurley talks, I listen. Well, now he's talking a lot. He and Brad Gerstner (another super smart VC) just started a new podcast called BG2. Yes, I know, another tech podcast. But this one offers some of the sharpest commentary I've heard on AI, self-driving cars, and chips. I highly recommend checking it out.\r\n​\r\nQuick music rec: I’m a huge fan of RAC.

are over 17,500 people subscribed to this newsletter now. That’s kind of mind blowing. Thanks for reading.\n\nI owe everything I have to writing. I’m not exaggerating. I was a nobody when I started MetaLab and the only reason I was able to win projects with Fortune 500 companies was because I wrote blog posts that hooked people. Later, with Tiny, I invested a huge amount of time writing viral posts on Twitter and it led to many of our best acquisitions. Today, that same skill—writing compelling things that make people take notice—continues to pay huge dividends for me and many of my most successful friends. Communicating in an impactful way pays off. It’s hard to learn, but there’s a shortcut that will accelerate your writing abilities massively. My friend David Perell, whose writing I’ve admired for years, has created a course called Write of Passage* that will level up your writing skills in a 5 week bootcamp. I can’t think of a better way to do so.\r\n​\r\nThink about the guts it would take to sign away the multi-billion-dollar fortune you’d spent decades building without telling a soul. In the early eighties, Chuck Feeney, the billionaire founder of Duty Free Shoppers, did just that. He secretly gave away 99.9% of his wealth to his philanthropic foundation, keeping only a million dollars for himself. For the rest of his life, he resided in a small San Francisco apartment, dedicating his time to giving the money away. There’s a great book about Chuck called The Billionaire Who Wasn’t. I just finished it and it’s incredibly inspiring. He died last year, giving away over $8 billion in his lifetime.\r\n​\r\n“If you got poo on your arm, would you wipe it with a tissue and go ‘perfect, as good as new?’ Of course not! You’d wash it.” My friend Rajiv is fond of giving this example when he sells people on the need for a Japanese style bidet toilet. I am one of his many converts. It's one of those things that you might not think you want or need until you experience it—for most people, during a visit to Japan, where they are ubiquitous (even in public bathrooms in shopping malls). I never thought I needed a heated toilet seat with automated washing and drying until I tried it. Now I’d never go back. It’s a silly luxury—an Eight Sleep for your rear end—but I highly recommend getting yourself a Toto Washlet.\r\n​\r\nOver the past few years I’ve gotten into weightlifting. I’ve spent a ton of time dialing in my supplements and nutrition, but the most heavily researched supplement, Creatine, is my achilles heel. No matter what, taking even a tiny amount of it turns my stomach almost instantly, slowing my progress at the gym. A few months ago, I was listening to The Random Show with Tim Ferriss and Kevin Rose, and they mentioned KreAlkalyn Creatine, a different formulation that is PH buffered and causes less stomach distress. Miraculously, it doesn’t affect my stomach at all, and I can take loads of the stuff. For my fellow creatine sensitive, it’s a great option. This one by EFX is what I use.\r\n​\r\nOne of our companies, KnoCommerce, just launched The DTC Index. It’s kind of like the S&P 500, but for direct-to-consumer e-commerce companies.

8, 2024\r\nHere is your week’s edition of Never Enough, a few things I’ve been exploring.\r\n​\n\nMy pal Ryan Norbauer used to run one of the top web development agencies in North America, which is how we became friends. A few years ago, he shut down his agency and started a…luxury keyboard atelier? I thought he had lost his mind. I’ve always just used the Apple Magic Keyboard and not thought twice about it. Then he sent me one of his $5,000 keyboards. Yes, you read that correctly. A fucking $5,000 keyboard. It felt like unboxing a Rolex, with a certificate of authenticity and everything, and it’s made of titanium. After a few months with it, I’m a convert. It’s one of the most absurd luxuries that I’ve enjoyed lately, but it has made typing (including these very words) an absolute pleasure. If you are having a midlife crisis, I highly recommend buying one of his keyboards. Much more satisfying than a red Porsche.\r\n​\r\nI hate burning money unnecessarily. To this day, nothing grinds me more than realizing that some SaaS software company has been billing one of my companies thousands of dollars for a product we no longer use. As we’ve grown, though, I found it tough to stay on top of this. We have 40+ companies, and ultimately we have bigger fish to fry—but this stuff matters. It adds up. Death by a thousand paper cuts. So, we launched a new company to solve this. It’s called Tech Source. They dig through your P&L for SaaS + hosting + API expenses, cut what you aren’t using, and negotiate the best possible price on the ones you are. They take a small monthly retainer then charge you a percent of the savings. Tell them I sent you.\r\n​\r\nJesper Kouthoofd, founder of popular Swedish clothing brand Acne, also lost his mind like my friend Ryan. He left the fashion industry to start an uber-cool design-y audio product company called Teenage Engineering. I recently bought their podcasting microphone, the CM-15, and it’s a thing of beauty. Most podcast mics look straight out of Howard Stern’s 90’s radio studio. This thing looks like it was designed by Dieter Rams.\r\n​\r\nYou may have seen the news, but we partnered with Dr. Andrew Huberman (from HubermanLab fame) and bought a majority stake in a yerba mate company called Mateina. I’ve been drinking the stuff daily for over a year now and it is by far the best caffeine delivery system around (120mg of caffeine without the jitters + mild appetite suppression). Andrew Huberman has worked with them over the past six months on a new sugar-free version, which we just launched.\r\n​\r\nStarting at around age five, I roamed my neighborhood in a pack with my friends. I remember being essentially free range. Apparently, kids don’t do that anymore, and it’s bad for them. I read an article by Mariana Brussoni about how kids need to take risk and do semi-dangerous things in order to develop confidence. I found the following quote and chart particularly alarming:\r\n​​\r\n“Between 1975 and 2015, outdoor play among UK children decreased by 29.4%, while screen-based activities increased by 22.4%. In the U.S., only 16% of children in 1997 played outdoors every day.

1, 2024\r\nHere is your week’s edition of Never Enough, a list of what I’ve been exploring.\r\n​\n\nMetalab, the product design agency I started back in 2006, just launched their first major rebrand in years: www.metalab.com\r\n​​\r\nCheck out this article from Inc. Magazine that came out this week. Bryan Elliot did a great job at capturing my story.\r\n​\r\nNothing pisses me off more than seeing huge recurring charges on my credit card for simple software. For example, I recently saw one of our companies paying $40,000 per year for glorified screenshot software. Jason and David from Basecamp are fighting this trend withOnce.com. TLDR: They’re building simple apps to replace all the basics companies rely on, starting with Slack (Campfire). You just pay $300, once, then you run it on your own server. Genius.\r\n​\r\nLast year, we teamed up with my friend James Clear, the author of Atomic Habits, to make the ultimate habits app. It’s called Atoms, and it launched yesterday. Debuted in the top 10 of the US App Store! Click here to learn more.​\r\n​​\r\nI’m a longtime user of Instapaper, but the king is dead. I’ve converted over to Readwise Reader and it’s UNBELIEVABLY good. A few features I love: perfectly imports PDFs with flawless OCR and highlighting / it has flawless text-to-speech / insanely fast keyboard driven interface.\r\n​\r\nMy friend Bill Ackman did a wide ranging interview on Lex Fridman and it's great, you can check it out here.\r\n​\r\nI never thought I’d say this, but I loved the Prince Harry book, Spare. It turns out it’sghost written by J.R. Moehringer, who has written some of my favourite biographies (Open by Andre Agassi and Shoe Dog by Phil Knight - both are incredible).

23, 2024\r\nHere is your week’s edition of Never Enough, a list of what I’ve been exploring.\r\n​\n\nA funny recommendation, but this week I got hit with a nasty stomach flu and would have been decimated if not for a miracle drug called Zofran (Ondansetron). It made it 10x less terrible than it could have been and basically eliminated my nausea. It’s an anti-nausea drug that is often used by chemotherapy patients. No major side effects other than a mild headache, which I’d take any day over nausea. Worth having in your medicine cabinet during flu season.\r\n​\r\nI love matcha, but I’ve always found making it kind of annoying (portioning, whisking, etc). My girlfriend got me a Cuzen Matcha machine for Christmas and I’ve been absolutely loving it. It automatically grids the tea leaves and whisks the matcha using a little magnetic stirring cup. It seemed like a gimmick when I got it, but I use it daily.\r\n​\r\nI get way too many text messages. Texts has been a game changer. It’s basically Superhuman for text messaging. Insanely fast and keyboard driven, it lets you pound through your text messages in a flash. It also supports all the major platforms (iMessage, Signal, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc) so it’s a unified inbox for all your messages. You can even filter texts into different views like work and personal. Texts was just acquired by my friend Matt Mullenweg over at Automattic. I’m excited to see how they evolve the product.\r\n​\r\nI’m a huge fan of Raycast. It’s a Mac utility that replaces Spotlight and lets you do a ton of neat stuff using keyboard commands, replacing the need to use the mouse or open apps (here’s a quick YouTube primer).\r\n​\r\nRecently, they released an extension called Dash Off. Basically, it lets you send quick emails to key team members without opening your email app.\r\n​\r\nI’ve always found that if I open my email, I’m bound to get distracted. This lets me hit a keyboard command, type a quick email, then get right back to work: https://www.raycast.com/peduarte/dash-off. Super handy.\r\n​\r\nI recently interviewed my friend Sam Parr for a new podcast I am developing. He sold me on the Ninja Creami. It’s basically an at-home ice cream maker that lets you make healthy (or unhealthy) ice cream, sorbet, and smoothie bowls. I tried it a few days ago and I’m hooked.

16, 2024\r\nHere is this week’s edition of Never Enough, a list of what I’ve been exploring, plus an interesting question from my Twitter subscriber community.\n\n‍ I’m reading two great books that counter balance one another:​\r\n​\r\nThe Coming wave by Mustafa Sulyman - \"Everything is about to be changed by AI in a radical, scary way\"\r\n​\r\nCounterbalanced by:\r\n​\r\n​Same As Ever by Morgan Housel - \"There are many things that never change\"\r\n‍\r\nI'm loving SuperWhisper, a voice recognition large language model that runs natively and does incredibly accurate dictation with perfect grammar and um/ah removal.\r\n‍\r\nI absolutely loved seeing Priscilla and The Killer in theaters recently.\r\nI feel like the last few years were pretty rough in Hollywood with COVID and we're finally seeing great films hit the theaters again.\r\n‍\r\nI recently bought a Dyson Solarcycle Morph reading light. It automatically turns on and off when you sit down next to it, and it automatically sets the light to warmer as the day goes on (for cozy warm light in the evening, and bright sharp white light in the mornings). Like all things Dyson, it’s beautifully designed and looks incredible in my den.\r\n‍\r\nI've never been able to keep up a daily journal, my friend Charlie Grinnell came up with an awesome workflow that I've been using. TLDR: You take a voice note, then use a custom AI prompt to form it into a well-written coherent journal entry in Reflect (or the journaling app of your choice).

the recent news to bring AI mainstream with Chat GPT, Grove, etc., does Tiny have any strict strategies on AI-related acquisitions?\n\nReally, we're just trying to think about how things get disrupted, and how quickly they get disrupted. So, we're being very, very strict about either buying businesses that we feel have a data moat, or something that makes them hard to compete with. We're trying to avoid anything that's easily recreated by AI, or just eliminated by AI. The problem is that that's constantly expanding.\n\nTo be honest, we're really looking at places outside tech, and then also distressed tech businesses right now, because we think we can have short-term payback. You know, at the end of the day, business is about betting. How long can this go? How much cash can it produce?

9, 2024\r\nIn 2016, I bid a staggering $57,000 for lunch with billionaire investor Bill Ackman.\n\nI had followed Bill’s career from a distance for years. He loved getting his hands dirty, helping the companies he invested, often with incredible results. He’s best known for transforming the Canadian Pacific Railway from the back of the pack into a leader in efficiency. By flipping the script on Canada’s least efficient railway, he turned it into a paragon of performance, pocketing an eye-popping profit of $2.6 billion. It’s the kind of move that turns a good investor into a legend.\n\nWhen Bill auctioned off a 1-hour lunch for charity, Chris and I went all in, we wanted to learn from him in person. We asked him about everything we could think of and was surprised by his brutal honesty about everything from investing, to business partnership, to marriage and raising children.","title":"February

a decade later, as my public persona has taken on a life of its own, I find myself in Bill’s shoes, fielding inquiries from both young and seasoned entrepreneurs seeking guidance. I get dozens of emails every day asking about my deal flow, how I hire CEOs, lessons from running agencies and now a public company, the due diligence process for our acquisitions, my podcast routine, daily supplements— the list goes on.\n\nInstead of spending my life on back-to-back calls, I’m inviting you, with this newsletter, into my day-to-day.\n\nOnce a week, I’ll share a list of five things that have caught my attention. Tools I’ve tried, products I’m loving, books I’m reading, and more. Think of it as a series of text messages sent directly to your inbox. But most importantly, I’ll be answering a question each week from my audience.
